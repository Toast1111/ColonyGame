# Medical System Revamp - Complete Package

## 📚 Documentation Overview

This package contains everything you need to revamp the medical system in your colony game. The system is designed following RimWorld's philosophy: **all colonists can treat injuries, but skill and medicine quality matter.**

   - Implementation phases
   - Testing checklist
   - **Best for:** Project planning

## ✅ What's Already Done

The foundation is built and working:

- ✅ Medical treatment definitions with quality system
- ✅ Medicine resource types (medicine, herbal)
- ✅ Treatment quality calculation (skill + medicine bonuses)
- ✅ Medical job creation and priority system
- ✅ Public API for colonist identification
- ✅ Initial medicine stock (5 medicine, 3 herbal)
- ✅ Project builds successfully

## 🚧 What Needs Implementation

5 files need small additions to make the system functional:

1. **`colonistFSM.ts`** - Add medical job check (1 code block, ~10 lines)
2. **`colonistFSM.ts`** - Add medical state handler (1 code block, ~40 lines)
3. **`colonistFSM.ts`** - Add downed state handler (1 code block, ~20 lines)
4. **`Game.ts`** - Fix context menu actions (1 code block, ~50 lines)
5. **`Game.ts`** - Add auto-downed check (1 code block, ~7 lines)

**Total: ~130 lines of code across 2 files**

## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Path

### Option 1: Quick Implementation (30 minutes)
1. Open `MEDICAL_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`
2. Follow the 5 code additions in order
3. Test after each addition
4. Done!

### Option 2: Understanding Implementation (1 hour)
1. Read `MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md` - understand the design
2. Read `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` - understand each problem
3. Implement using `MEDICAL_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`
4. Test thoroughly

### Option 3: Gradual Implementation (Multiple sessions)
**Session 1 (30 min):** Basic medical work
- Add File 1 & 2 from visual guide
- Test colonists treating each other

**Session 2 (20 min):** Downed state
- Add File 3 & 5 from visual guide
- Test colonists collapsing

**Session 3 (20 min):** Polish
- Add File 4 from visual guide
- Test context menu actions

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

After implementing, test these scenarios:

### ✅ Scenario 1: Auto-Treatment
1. Let enemy attack colonist
2. **Expected:** Another colonist automatically treats them
3. **Expected:** Treatment completes after ~30 seconds
4. **Expected:** Injury improves

### ✅ Scenario 2: Context Menu
1. Right-click injured colonist
2. Select "Medical" → "Bandage Wounds"
3. **Expected:** Bleeding reduces
4. **Expected:** Message confirms action

### ✅ Scenario 3: Downed & Rescue
1. Severely injure colonist (multiple wounds)
2. **Expected:** Colonist collapses
3. **Expected:** Can rescue via context menu
4. **Expected:** Colonist rests in bed

## 🎮 How The System Works

### Before (Current State)
- ❌ Medical jobs created but never assigned
- ❌ Colonists ignore injured allies
- ❌ Context menu options don't work
- ❌ Injured colonists stuck with low mobility forever

### After (With Implementation)
- ✅ Colonists automatically detect injured allies
- ✅ Medical jobs auto-assigned by priority
- ✅ Treatment quality based on skill + medicine
- ✅ Severely injured colonists collapse and get rescued
- ✅ All context menu options functional

### Example Gameplay Flow
```
1. Alice shot by raider → Gunshot wound to torso
2. Bleeding, high pain → Consciousness dropping
3. Bob (nearby, healthy) → Auto-assigned medical job
4. Bob moves to Alice → Treats wound with medicine
5. Treatment quality 75% → Bleeding stopped, infection prevented
6. Alice recovers slowly → Returns to work

If Alice had collapsed:
3. System creates rescue job
4. Bob picks up Alice
5. Bob carries to bed
6. Carol treats Alice in bed
7. Alice recovers while resting
```

## 📊 System Features

### Treatment Quality Formula
```
Quality = Base Quality + (Skill × 0.03) + Medicine Bonus

Base Quality:
- No Medicine: 30%
- Herbal: 50%
- Medicine: 75%

Skill Bonus:
- +3% per skill level
- Max +60% at skill 20

Medicine Bonus:
- Herbal: +10%
- Medicine: +20%
```

### Medical Priorities
1. **CRITICAL** - Downed, severe bleeding
2. **URGENT** - Infections, moderate bleeding
3. **NORMAL** - High pain, severe injuries
4. **ROUTINE** - Minor wounds

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- **Issue:** TypeScript errors after adding code
- **Fix:** Check for missing imports at top of file
- **Import needed:** `import { medicalSystem } from "../health/medicalSystem";`

### Runtime Errors
- **Issue:** "medicalSystem.getColonistId is not a function"
- **Fix:** Already fixed - method is public now

- **Issue:** Colonists don't perform medical work
- **Fix:** Make sure you added code from File 1 (medical job check)

### Gameplay Issues
- **Issue:** Medicine not consumed
- **Fix:** Check `this.RES.medicine` exists and is > 0

- **Issue:** No medical jobs created
- **Fix:** Colonists need health system initialized and injuries

## 📈 Future Enhancements

See `MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md` for full roadmap:

- Medical room quality bonuses
- Hospital beds

## 🙏 Credits & Design Philosophy

This system is heavily inspired by **RimWorld's** medical system:
- Emergent storytelling through system interactions
- Depth through simple, interconnected systems
- Player agency with indirect control
- Realistic needs and consequences
