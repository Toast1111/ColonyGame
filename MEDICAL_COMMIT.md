## Commit Message

```
feat: Medical system revamp foundation + implementation guides

Core Changes:
- Added medicine & herbal resource types to game
- Made medicalSystem.getColonistId() public for FSM access
- Added initial medicine stock (5 medicine, 3 herbal)

Documentation:
- MEDICAL_README.md: Quick start overview
- MEDICAL_VISUAL_GUIDE.md: Copy-paste implementation guide
- MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md: Detailed problem solutions
- MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md: Full RimWorld-inspired design
- MEDICAL_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md: Status & testing checklist

What Works:
‚úÖ Medical treatment system with quality calculations
‚úÖ Skill + medicine affect treatment outcomes
‚úÖ Medicine resource tracking
‚úÖ Medical job creation and priority system

What Needs Implementation (~30 min):
‚è≥ FSM medical job check (File 1)
‚è≥ FSM medical state handler (File 2)
‚è≥ FSM downed state handler (File 3)
‚è≥ Context menu medical actions (File 4)
‚è≥ Auto-downed state trigger (File 5)

Implementation: Follow MEDICAL_VISUAL_GUIDE.md for exact code locations

RimWorld-inspired: All colonists can treat, skill matters
```

## Next Steps

1. Review documentation files
2. Follow MEDICAL_VISUAL_GUIDE.md to implement remaining features
3. Test each phase independently
4. Commit changes when complete

## Implementation Time Estimate

- **Basic medical work:** 15 minutes (Files 1-2)
- **Downed state:** 10 minutes (Files 3, 5)
- **Context menu fixes:** 5 minutes (File 4)
- **Testing:** 10 minutes

**Total: ~40 minutes** for full working medical system

## Testing Command

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] Colonists automatically treat injured allies
- [ ] Treatment messages appear in game log
- [ ] Context menu medical actions work
- [ ] Medicine count decreases when used
- [ ] Severely injured colonists collapse
- [ ] Rescue option appears for downed colonists
