# React UI

This folder contains React-driven UI used as overlays atop the Canvas game.

Structure:
- gameOver/ — game-over overlay sequence (fade, messages, memorial, credits)
- stores/ — lightweight state containers for overlays
- components/ — shared UI components
- ui/ — feature-level UI modules
- hooks/ — reusable React hooks

Use the barrel exports in [index.ts](index.ts) where possible.
