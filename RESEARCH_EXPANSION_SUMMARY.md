## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- Research database expanded to 43 nodes
- All prerequisites properly chained
- Grid positioning for visual tree layout
- TypeScript compilation verified

### ⚠️ Needs Implementation
Most of these buildings, items, and mechanics are **defined but not yet implemented** in the game code. To make research meaningful, the following need to be created:

1. **Building Definitions** - Add 50+ buildings to `buildings.ts` with functionality
2. **Item Definitions** - Create item database with stats for weapons, armor, materials
3. **Game Mechanics** - Implement special mechanics (power grid, automation, genetics, etc.)
4. **Crafting Recipes** - Define how to craft new items using new materials
5. **FSM Integration** - Add colonist behaviors for new work types
6. **UI Updates** - Show unlocked buildings/items in build menus

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Basic Buildings** - Implement simple buildings first (stove, smokehouse, freezer, quarry, mine)
2. **Industry Chain** - Complete mining → smelting → crafting chain with materials
3. **Weapon/Armor Items** - Create item definitions and equipping system
4. **Power System** - Implement electricity generation and consumption
5. **Medical Items** - Add prosthetics/bionics as wearable items
6. **Advanced Mechanics** - Automation, genetics, AI systems (end-game content)

## Visual Tree Layout

Research nodes are positioned on a grid (240px × 160px spacing):
- **X-axis**: Technology progression (0 = basic, 10 = end-game)
- **Y-axis**: Category separation (0 = industry/military, 1 = agriculture/food, 2 = military/animals, 3 = medicine)
- Color-coded connections show prerequisites
- Deep tech trees create natural progression goals

## Balance Notes

- Early techs (50-200 RP) unlock basic survival needs
- Mid techs (200-450 RP) provide strategic options
- Late techs (450-900 RP) offer powerful advantages
- End-game techs (900-1800 RP) are game-changing but expensive
- Longest research: Teleportation (1800 RP, 450 seconds = 7.5 minutes)
- Most research requires 2-4 prerequisites, creating branching paths

## Files Modified

- `src/game/research/researchDatabase.ts` - Expanded from ~250 lines to ~720 lines
  - Added 28 new research nodes
  - 100+ new building unlocks
  - 60+ new item unlocks
  - 30+ new mechanic unlocks
