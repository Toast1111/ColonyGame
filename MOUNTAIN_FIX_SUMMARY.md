# Mountain Collision Fix - Final Summary

## Problem Resolved

This PR fixes two critical issues with mountain tile interactions in the Colony Game:

1. **Enemies spawning on impassable mountain tiles** - causing them to phase through mountains
2. **Colonists getting stuck on mountains during hauling** - becoming permanently unable to move

## Solution Overview

The fix implements **minimal surgical changes** to three key files:

### 1. Enemy Spawn Validation (`src/game/Game.ts`)
- Added 20-attempt retry loop to find valid spawn positions
- Validates spawn is not on mountain tile
- Validates spawn grid cell is passable
- Fallback to HQ-relative spawn if no valid edge position found

### 2. Colonist Mountain Collision (`src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`)
- Enhanced `wouldCollideWithBuildings()` to check mountains
- Single O(1) array lookup per movement validation
- Existing stuck detection automatically rescues from mountains

### 3. Enemy Mountain Collision (`src/ai/enemyFSM.ts`)
- Same enhancement as colonist FSM
- Prevents enemies from phasing through mountains
- Maintains consistent behavior with colonist movement

## Technical Details

### Code Changes
- **Total lines modified**: ~70 lines across 3 files
- **Performance impact**: Negligible (O(1) array lookups)
- **Breaking changes**: None
- **Dependencies added**: None

### Security
- ✅ CodeQL scan: 0 alerts
- ✅ No new attack vectors
- ✅ All array accesses bounds-checked

### Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build successful
- ✅ Manual testing guide provided
- ⚠️ Manual verification recommended (see `MOUNTAIN_FIX_TESTING.md`)

## Implementation Philosophy

This fix follows the **minimal change approach**:
- No refactoring of working systems
- No changes to pathfinding (already correct)
- Leveraged existing `isMountainTile()` function
- Additive collision checks only
- No premature optimization

## Documentation

Two comprehensive guides provided:
1. **MOUNTAIN_FIX_TESTING.md** - Step-by-step manual testing instructions
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md** - Technical deep-dive and rationale

## Verification Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Vite build succeeds
- [x] CodeQL security scan passes (0 alerts)
- [x] No build artifacts in commit
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] Manual gameplay testing (see MOUNTAIN_FIX_TESTING.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Use debug console to verify fixes:
   - Spawn enemies near mountains
   - Test colonist hauling near mountains
   - Verify no clipping through terrain

2. **Merge**: Once manual testing confirms fixes work as expected

3. **Monitor**: Watch for any edge cases in gameplay

## Debug Commands for Testing

```
` - Open debug console
toggle enemies - Disable night spawns
spawn enemy 10 - Test enemy spawning
spawn colonist 5 - Test colonist behavior
resources unlimited - For extended testing
```

## Conclusion

This PR implements the **smallest possible changes** to fix both issues while maintaining code quality and system integrity. The fixes are:
- ✅ Surgical (3 files, ~70 lines)
- ✅ Safe (0 security alerts)
- ✅ Performant (O(1) operations)
- ✅ Well-documented (2 guides)
- ✅ Non-breaking (additive only)
