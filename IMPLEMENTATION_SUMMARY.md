# Implementation Summary: Immunity and Healing Rate Improvements

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds comprehensive RimWorld-style immunity generation and wound healing rate systems to the Colony Game, as specified in the requirements.

## Key Features

### 1. Immunity Generation Rate System
✅ **Dynamic immunity calculation** based on multiple factors:
- Hunger penalties: -10% (hungry) to -30% (starving)
- Fatigue penalties: -4% (tired) to -20% (extreme fatigue)
- Age penalties: -1% per year starting at age 54, max -50%
- Bed bonuses: +10% for lying down, plus bed type bonus (medical bed +11%)
- Implant bonuses: Immunizer +8% each (max 2), Filtering kidneys +2.5% each (max 2)
- Organ health: Kidney and liver health strongly affect immunity (multiplicative)
- Trait modifiers: -10% to +50% based on genetic/trait factors

### 2. Wound Healing Rate System
✅ **Healing points per day** calculation:
- Base: 8 healing points
- Treatment quality bonus: +4 + (0.08 × quality × 100)
- Bed type bonus: Floor +4, Basic bed +8, Medical bed +14
- Healer implant: 1.5× multiplier
- Gene/trait multipliers: 0.5×, 2×, or 4× based on traits
- Maximum achievable: 204 healing points/day (matches RimWorld spec)

### 3. New Data Structures

**Health Implants:**
```typescript
interface HealthImplant {
  type: 'immunizer' | 'filtering_kidneys' | 'healer' | ...
  quality: number;
  label: string;
}
```

**Extended ColonistHealth:**
- `implants?: HealthImplant[]`
- `kidneyHealth?: number` (0-1)
- `liverHealth?: number` (0-1)

**Extended Injury:**
- `treatmentQuality?: number` (0-1, used for healing calculations)

### 4. New Passive Traits

**Immunity Traits:**
- `weak_immunity`: -10% immunity gain
- `good_immunity`: +10% immunity gain
- `hardy`: +30% immunity gain
- `super_immune`: +50% immunity gain

**Healing Traits:**
- `slow_healer`: 0.5× healing rate
- `quick_healer`: 2× healing rate
- `very_fast_healer`: 4× healing rate

## Files Modified

1. **src/game/types.ts**
   - Added `HealthImplant` interface
   - Extended `ColonistHealth` with implants and organ health
   - Extended `Injury` with `treatmentQuality`

2. **src/game/health/healthSystem.ts**
   - Added `calculateImmunityGainRate()` function
   - Added `calculateHealingPointsPerDay()` function
   - Updated `tickInfections()` to use dynamic immunity rate
   - Updated `healInjuries()` to use healing points system
   - Updated `initializeColonistHealth()` to set default organ health and implants

3. **src/game/health/medicalSystem.ts**
   - Modified `performTreatment()` to pass doctor skill to treatment application
   - Updated `applySuccessfulTreatment()` to calculate and store treatment quality

4. **src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts**
   - Updated function calls to pass colonist instead of just health

5. **src/game/colonist_systems/colonistGenerator.ts**
   - Added `passiveTraits` field to `ColonistProfile` interface

6. **src/game/colonist_systems/traits/passiveTraits.ts**
   - Added 8 new medical traits for immunity and healing

7. **.gitignore**
   - Added exclusions for compiled JS files to prevent build issues

## Files Created

1. **docs/medical/IMMUNITY_AND_HEALING_SYSTEMS.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation of both systems
   - Example calculations and scenarios
   - Balance notes and future enhancement suggestions

## Testing

Formula verification tests confirmed all calculations match RimWorld specifications:

### Immunity Tests (10 scenarios)
- ✅ Base case: 100%
- ✅ Hungry: 90%
- ✅ Starving: 70%
- ✅ Age 70: 84%
- ✅ Age 104: 50% (max penalty)
- ✅ Medical bed: 122.1%
- ✅ 2× Immunizers: 116%
- ✅ 2× Filtering kidneys: 105%
- ✅ 50% organ health: 50%
- ✅ Super immune trait: 150%

### Healing Tests (10 scenarios)
- ✅ Base (floor): 12 points/day
- ✅ Basic bed: 16 points/day
- ✅ Medical bed: 22 points/day
- ✅ 50% quality treatment: 20 points/day
- ✅ 100% quality treatment: 24 points/day
- ✅ Healer implant: 18 points/day
- ✅ Quick healer (2×): 24 points/day
- ✅ Very fast healer (4×): 48 points/day
- ✅ Best case: 204 points/day (matches spec!)
- ✅ Starving: 0 points/day

## Build Status

✅ Build successful
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All formulas validated

## How It Works In-Game

### Immunity System
1. Colonists build immunity to infections over time
2. Rate is calculated each infection tick (every 4 seconds)
3. Factors stack multiplicatively for deep emergent gameplay
4. Players must balance colonist needs (food, rest) for optimal recovery

### Healing System
1. Injuries heal based on healing points per day
2. Better care = faster healing (treatment, beds, implants)
3. Starvation prevents healing entirely
4. Traits create 8× variance between slowest and fastest healers

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to support:
- Medicine types (herbal, standard, advanced)
- Disease-specific immunity speeds
- Organ transplants and rejection mechanics
- Environmental factors (cleanliness, temperature)
- Doctor skill specializations

## Integration Notes

The systems integrate seamlessly with existing medical infrastructure:
- Medical work giver assigns doctors to treat patients
- FSM handles colonist behavior (resting in beds, etc.)
- Treatment quality is calculated from doctor skill
- All calculations respect game speed and time scaling

## Performance Impact

Minimal - calculations only run:
- Immunity: Every 4 seconds per colonist with injuries
- Healing: Every frame per colonist with injuries
- Both use simple arithmetic with early returns
