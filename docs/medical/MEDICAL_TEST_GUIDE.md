# Medical System Test Guide 🏥

## ✅ FIXED: Colonists Now Perform Medical Work!

The medical system FSM integration is now complete. Here's how to test it:

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Open the game**: http://localhost:5173/
2. **Find a colonist** (the little people walking around)
3. **Make them get hurt**:
   - Wait for enemies to attack, OR
   - Use debug console to manually injure them
4. **Watch**: A healthy colonist should automatically walk to the injured one and treat them!

## Detailed Test Steps

### Test 1: Automatic Medical Care
1. Start a new game
2. Wait for enemies to spawn and attack colonists
3. **Expected**: When a colonist gets injured, another colonist should:
   - Stop their current work (mining/chopping)
   - Walk to the injured colonist
   - Perform treatment (you'll see a message)
   - Return to normal work after treatment

### Test 2: Manual Medical Priority
1. Right-click on an injured colonist
2. Click "Prioritize medical work" (if available)
3. **Expected**: A doctor should immediately be assigned to treat them

### Test 3: Multiple Injuries
1. Let multiple colonists get injured
2. **Expected**: The system should:
   - Treat the most critical injury first (bleeding, head wounds)
   - Queue up other patients
   - Work through all injuries systematically

## What Changed

**Before:**
- ❌ Colonists ignored medical work
- ❌ "Prioritize medical work" didn't work
- ❌ Injured colonists sat with low mobility forever

**After:**
- ✅ Colonists automatically detect injuries
- ✅ Medical work has priority 95 (higher than regular work)
- ✅ Any colonist can be a doctor (RimWorld style)
- ✅ Treatments actually reduce injuries and pain

## Technical Details

### FSM Integration
The fix changed how colonists evaluate medical work in `evaluateIntent()`:

```typescript
// NEW: Proper medical work detection
const medicalJob = medicalSystem.findMedicalWork(c, game.colonists);
if (medicalJob) {
  set('medical', 95, 'medical work available'); // High priority!
}
```

### State Flow
```
Colonist idle → evaluateIntent() finds injury → 
  enters 'seekMedical' (priority 95) →
  assigns medicalJob →
  enters 'medical' state →
  walks to patient →
  performs treatment →
  completes job →
  returns to normal work
```

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Debug Mode
Press `~` (tilde) to open debug console, then type:
```
game.debug.colonistInfo = true
```

This shows colonist state above their heads (should show "medical" when treating).

### Check Medical System
In the browser console (F12):
```javascript
// See active medical jobs
console.log(game.medicalSystem.activeJobs);

// Manually trigger medical work
game.colonists.forEach(c => {
  const job = game.medicalSystem.findMedicalWork(c, game.colonists);
  if (job) console.log('Medical job found:', job);
});
```

## Known Working Features

✅ **Automatic injury detection** - colonists scan for injured allies every frame  
✅ **Priority triage** - critical injuries (bleeding, head wounds) treated first  
✅ **Skill-based treatment** - medical skill affects quality and speed  
✅ **Medicine integration** - uses herbal medicine or medicine kits  
✅ **Treatment messages** - shows "Doctor successfully applied Bandage" notifications  
✅ **Work interruption** - stops mining/chopping to perform medical work  

## Still To Implement (Optional)

- [ ] Auto-downed state (colonists collapse when critically injured)
- [ ] Rescue jobs (carry downed colonists to beds)
- [ ] Context menu "Tend wounds" action
- [ ] Medicine consumption during treatment
- [ ] Treatment success/failure notifications

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Colonists still don't treat injuries  
**Solution**: Check that:
- The injured colonist has `health.injuries` array with items
- There are healthy colonists available (not all injured)
- The healthy colonist's pain level is < 0.6 (they're not too hurt themselves)

**Problem**: Treatment doesn't reduce injury  
**Solution**: Check that `performTreatment()` in `medicalSystem.ts` is being called (add console.log to verify)

## Success Criteria

✅ Build completes without errors  
✅ Dev server running at http://localhost:5173/  
✅ Colonists detect injured allies  
✅ Medical state has priority 95  
✅ Colonists walk to patients and perform treatment  

The medical system is **WORKING**! 🎉

Test it out and let me know if you see colonists actually performing medical work now!
