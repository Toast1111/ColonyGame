# Terrain Floor System - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## Summary

**The legacy path building system has been completely replaced with a proper terrain-based floor system!**

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
1. **Terrain Grid System** (`src/game/terrain.ts`)
   - Separate terrain and floor layers
   - 13 terrain types (grass, mud, sand, etc.)
   - 7 floor types (path, stone road, wooden floor, etc.)
   - Movement cost calculation: `terrain × floor`

2. **Pathfinding Integration** (`src/core/pathfinding.ts`)
   - `syncTerrainToGrid()` syncs terrain costs to A* pathfinding
   - Region system integration for performance
   - Grid-based enemy navigation (no snap-back!)

3. **Floor Building System** (`src/game/buildings.ts`)
   - **Removed**: Legacy `path` building type
   - **Added**: `floor_path`, `floor_stone_road`, `floor_wooden`
   - All floors use `isFloor: true` flag
   - Proper cost system (free paths, 2 stone for roads, 3 wood for floors)

### ✅ Placement System (`src/game/placement/placementSystem.ts`)
1. **Single Tile Placement**
   - Click to place individual floor tiles
   - Resource checking and deduction
   - Collision detection with buildings
   - Prevents placing on existing floors

2. **Paint Mode**
   - Drag to paint continuous paths
   - Bresenham line algorithm for smooth paths
   - Works with all floor types (selected building determines floor type)
   - Automatic terrain sync after painting

3. **Smart Validation**
   - Can't place floor under buildings
   - Can't place floor on existing floors
   - Bounds checking
   - Resource cost validation

### ✅ Visual System
1. **Terrain Debug Rendering** (`src/game/terrainDebugRender.ts`)
   - Press `T` to toggle terrain/floor visualization
   - Semi-transparent floor overlays
   - Floor type labels (P=Path, R=Road, W=Wooden, etc.)
   - Grid lines for precise placement

2. **Integration in Game**
   - Debug flag: `game.debug.terrain`
   - Renders after regions, before nav grid
   - Shows movement costs visually

### ✅ Floor Types Available

| Floor Type | Hotkey | Cost | Speed Multiplier | Use Case |
|------------|--------|------|------------------|----------|
| **Dirt Path** | `0` | FREE | 0.6x (40% faster) | Basic paths, general traffic |
| **Stone Road** | `9` | 2 stone | 0.5x (50% faster) | Premium roads, high-traffic areas |
| **Wooden Floor** | `8` | 3 wood | 0.65x (35% faster) | Interior flooring, buildings |

### ✅ Game Integration (`src/game/Game.ts`)
1. **Initialization**
   - `terrainGrid` created in constructor
   - Linked to pathfinding grid: `grid.terrainGrid = terrainGrid`
   - Synced on startup: `syncTerrainToGrid(grid)`

2. **Input Handling**
   - Floor types trigger paint mode: `if (def?.isFloor) paintPathAtMouse()`
   - Works with mouse drag, touch, and precise placement
   - Debug toggle: `T` key

3. **Type Safety**
   - Added `Flooring` category to BuildingDef
   - Added `isFloor` and `floorType` properties
   - Proper TypeScript types throughout

## How It Works

### Building a Floor

```typescript
// User selects floor type and clicks
1. tryPlaceNow(game, 'floor_path', wx, wy)
   
2. Check if floor type:
   if (def.isFloor && def.floorType)
   
3. Validate placement:
   - Check bounds
   - Check no existing floor
   - Check no building overlap
   - Check resources
   
4. Place in terrain system:
   setFloorRect(terrainGrid, gx, gy, 1, 1, FloorType.BASIC_PATH)
   
5. Update pathfinding:
   syncTerrainToGrid(grid)
   rebuildNavGrid()
   
6. Done! Enemies and colonists now use the path
```

### Pathfinding Integration

```typescript
// Terrain costs automatically used by A*
Enemy at A → Target at B

Path with grass:
  Cost per tile = 1.0 (grass) × 1.0 (no floor) = 1.0

Path with dirt path:
  Cost per tile = 1.0 (grass) × 0.6 (path) = 0.6
  40% FASTER!

Path with stone road:
  Cost per tile = 1.0 (grass) × 0.5 (road) = 0.5
  50% FASTER!

Path through mud with stone road:
  Cost per tile = 2.5 (mud) × 0.5 (road) = 1.25
  Still slow, but better than mud alone (2.5)!
```

## Testing & Verification

### ✅ Verified Working
- [x] Click to place floor tiles
- [x] Drag to paint paths
- [x] Three floor types with different costs/speeds
- [x] Resource deduction
- [x] Pathfinding uses floor bonuses
- [x] Terrain debug visualization (T key)
- [x] Collision detection (no floors under buildings)
- [x] No duplicate floors
- [x] Touch and desktop both work
- [x] Paint mode with Bresenham line algorithm
- [x] Terrain costs sync to pathfinding grid
- [x] Region system integration

### 🎮 How to Test
1. Start game: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5174
2. Press `0` to select Dirt Path (free)
3. Click and drag to paint a path
4. Press `9` to select Stone Road (2 stone)
5. Paint a stone road parallel to the path
6. Press `T` to toggle terrain debug
7. Watch colonists/enemies prefer the faster roads!

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ Proper Layer Separation
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Buildings (structures)         │  ← Objects, entities
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Floors (terrain layer)         │  ← Ground modifications
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Terrain (base ground)          │  ← Natural biomes
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ✅ Performance Optimized
- **Memory**: Uint8Array (1 byte per tile) = ~56 KB total
- **CPU**: Pre-computed costs, no runtime calculation
- **Pathfinding**: Uses cached `grid.cost[]` array
- **Region**: O(r) reachability check before O(n log n) A*

### ✅ Future-Proof
- Easy to add new floor types
- Ready for biomes (swamp, desert, tundra)
- Weather effects integration ready
- Terrain modification support
- Save/load compatible (Uint8Array serialization)
