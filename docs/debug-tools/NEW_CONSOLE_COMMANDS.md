## Implementation Details

**File:** `src/game/ui/debugConsole.ts`

**Lines Added:** ~200 lines (7 new commands with multiple sub-commands)

**Pattern:**
```typescript
reg("commandName", (g, args) => {
  const action = (args[0] || "default").toLowerCase();
  // Command logic
  return "result message";
}, "help text â€” description");
```

**Integration:**
- Commands use existing game state access patterns
- No new dependencies required
- All commands check for valid state before executing
- User-friendly error messages for invalid usage
