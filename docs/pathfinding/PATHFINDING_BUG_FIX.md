# Pathfinding Floor Bug - FIXED! âœ…

## Problem Statement
**"The new pathfinding system is not pathing agents over the path tiles."**

## Root Cause
The pathfinding grid rebuild process was **wiping out terrain/floor costs**:
- `rebuildNavGrid()` â†’ `clearGrid()` â†’ Reset all costs to 1.0
- Floor costs (0.5, 0.6, 0.65) were LOST
- Pathfinding saw uniform 1.0 costs everywhere
- **No incentive to route over floors!**

## Solution (2 Fixes)

### Fix #1: Restore Costs After Grid Clear
**File**: `src/game/navigation/navGrid.ts`

```typescript
export function rebuildNavGrid(game: Game) {
  clearGrid(game.grid);
  
  // âœ… NEW: Restore terrain/floor costs after clearing
  if (game.grid.terrainGrid) {
    syncTerrainToGrid(game.grid);
  }
  
  // Buildings...
}
```

### Fix #2: Preserve Costs During Section Rebuilds
**File**: `src/core/pathfinding.ts`

```typescript
function clearSection(grid: Grid, sectionX: number, sectionY: number): void {
  // ...
  for (let gy = startY; gy < endY; gy++) {
    for (let gx = startX; gx < endX; gx++) {
      const idx = gy * grid.cols + gx;
      grid.solid[idx] = 0;
      
      // âœ… NEW: Restore from terrain grid instead of resetting to 1.0
      if (grid.terrainGrid) {
        grid.cost[idx] = calculateMovementCost(grid.terrainGrid, gx, gy);
      } else {
        grid.cost[idx] = 1.0;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What Now Works

âœ… **Agents route over floors** - Pathfinding prefers low-cost tiles  
âœ… **Costs persist** - Grid rebuilds preserve floor costs  
âœ… **Colonists use roads** - Follow stone roads (0.5) over grass (1.0)  
âœ… **Enemies use roads** - Take efficient paths when available  
âœ… **Movement speed matches** - Speed = baseSpeed / tileCost (from previous fix)  

## Quick Test

```javascript
// 1. Place stone road
game.terrainGrid.floors[idx] = 5;  // FLOOR_STONE_ROAD
game.syncTerrainToGrid();
game.grid.cost[idx];  // = 0.5 âœ…

// 2. Rebuild grid (simulates building placement)
game.rebuildNavGrid();
game.grid.cost[idx];  // STILL 0.5 âœ… (Bug is fixed!)

// 3. Agent paths over road
const path = game.computePath(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y);
// Path now prefers roads (0.5 cost) over grass (1.0 cost) âœ…
```

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/game/navigation/navGrid.ts` | Restore terrain costs after `clearGrid()` | 1-15 |
| `src/core/pathfinding.ts` | Preserve terrain costs in `clearSection()` | 240-250 |

## Complete System Flow

```
1. Player places stone road
   â†’ terrainGrid.floors[idx] = FLOOR_STONE_ROAD
   
2. syncTerrainToGrid()
   â†’ grid.cost[idx] = 0.5
   
3. Player builds nearby (triggers rebuild)
   â†’ rebuildNavGrid() called
   â†’ clearGrid() resets to 1.0
   â†’ syncTerrainToGrid() âœ… restores to 0.5
   
4. A* pathfinding
   â†’ Evaluates neighbors
   â†’ stepCost = moveCost Ã— grid.cost[idx]
   â†’ Prefers 0.5 (road) over 1.0 (grass)
   â†’ Routes over floors! âœ…
```

## Impact

**Before**: Roads were cosmetic - agents ignored them  
**After**: Roads provide pathfinding benefit - agents prefer them  

The disconnect between terrain costs and pathfinding has been **completely eliminated**! ðŸŽ‰
