## Critical Issues

### 🔴 1. No Tutorial System
**Problem:** Players get single welcome message, must learn by trial/error

**Impact:** HIGH - Steep learning curve, low player retention

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Suggested 5-step tutorial:
1. "Colonists auto-gather resources. Click a tree to watch."
2. "Press B to open build menu. Build a farm."
3. "Build a house to increase population capacity."
4. "Night brings enemies! Build a turret for defense."
5. "Press P to manage work priorities. Tutorial complete!"
```

---

### 🟡 2. Keyboard Shortcuts Hidden
**Problem:** No in-game keyboard legend

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Players miss useful features (P for priorities, F for fast-forward, ~ for console)

**Quick Fix:** Add to help panel (H key):
```html
<div><b>Controls:</b>
  B: Build Menu | P: Work Priorities | H: Help
  Space: Pause | F: Fast Forward | ESC: Cancel
  1-9: Quick Build | WASD: Pan Camera | +/-: Zoom
  ~: Debug Console | RMB: Context Menu
</div>
```

---

### 🟡 3. Work Priority System Unexplained
**Problem:** "P" opens complex grid with no explanation

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Powerful feature unused by players

**Quick Fix:** Add tooltip above grid:
```html
"Click cells to cycle priority: Blank → 1 (highest) → 2 → 3 → 4 (lowest)"
```

---

## Quick Wins (1-2 hours)

### ✅ 1. Add Building Tooltips
```typescript
// In build menu, on hover:
"Farm - Cost: 30 wood - Produces wheat every 60s"
"House - Cost: 20 wood, 10 stone - Increases pop cap by 2"
"Turret - Cost: 50 wood, 30 stone - Auto-fires at enemies"
```

### ✅ 2. Add Contextual Tips
```typescript
// First injury:
msg("Tip: Build an Infirmary to treat injuries", 'info');

// Storage 80% full:
msg("Tip: Build a Warehouse to increase storage capacity", 'info');

// Night approaching, no turrets:
msg("Tip: Build Turrets before night to defend against raids", 'warn');
```

### ✅ 3. Add Keyboard Legend
Update help panel with complete shortcut list (see issue #2)

Add explanation text in work priority panel header
