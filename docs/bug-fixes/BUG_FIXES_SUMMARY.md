# Colony Game Bug Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues (This PR)

### 1. Building Resource Refunds ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Deleted buildings did not refund resources.

**Fix:** 
- Added `refundCost()` function to `buildings.ts`
- Buildings now refund 75% for completed, 50-100% for under construction
- Displays refund amounts in messages

### 2. Work Priority System ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Colonists switched to lower-priority tasks after completing one high-priority job.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced task sorting to prefer continuing same work type
- Added work type affinity when priorities are equal
- Imported `getWorkTypeForTask()` for work type tracking

### 3. Resource Hauling Display ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Bread/wheat not visible in colonist inventories.

**Fix:**
- Added carrying indicators to hover tooltips (üåæ/üçû)
- Enhanced debug mode with wheat/bread counts
- Visual indicators show above colonists

### 4. Idle State Loop ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Colonists stuck in idle state without recovering.

**Fix:**
- Removed random 5% chance for task re-assignment
- Colonists always seek new work when idle
- Immediate response to new work availability

### 5. Draft Movement Grid Alignment ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Draft mode movement not grid-aligned.

**Fix:**
- Drafted positions now snap to grid center
- Uses 32px tile size for alignment
- Consistent with building placement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues (Not Addressed)

### Combat & Health Systems
- **Combat accuracy bypass** - Ranged/melee always hit, ignoring miss probability
- **Bleeding system** - Always shows 0%, bleeding effects don't occur
- **Pain management** - Applied even when pain is 0%
- **Medical treatment** - Instant without animation, patients don't stay still
- **Haul to bed teleportation** - Downed colonists teleport instead of being carried

### Performance & Rendering
- **Off-screen colonists slower** - Simulation tick handling issue
- **Floor tiles rendering** - May be draw order or batching issue (system appears correct)
- **Random path blocking tiles** - Red squares appear in pathfinding debug

### UI/UX
- **Missing progress bars** - No visual indicators for farming, mining, chopping, eating, medical
- **Pathfinding in draft mode** - Paths not drawn to moving destinations
- **Sound effects** - Only work for select buildings (farms, houses, stoves, doors)

### Notes
- Floor rendering system appears correctly implemented but may need investigation
- Combat and health systems likely need deeper refactoring
- Progress bar system needs UI implementation
- Off-screen simulation may need adaptive tick rate tuning
