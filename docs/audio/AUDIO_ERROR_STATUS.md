# Audio System Status Update

## Current Status: ✅ Partially Fixed

### What Changed
The **unhandled promise rejections** have been successfully fixed. The errors are now being caught and logged as warnings instead of crashing.

### Error Messages Explained

#### Before Fix
```
[unhandledrejection] Bc@https://toast1111.github.io/ColonyGame/...
```
**Status**: ❌ CRASH - Unhandled promise rejection

#### After Fix
```
[console.warn] [Game] Failed to play audio: buildings.construct.stone.hammer
```
**Status**: ✅ HANDLED - Graceful degradation with warning

### Why Audio is Failing

The audio files exist and the keys are correctly configured, but audio might be failing to play due to:

1. **Browser Autoplay Restrictions** - Most browsers block audio without user interaction
2. **CORS Issues** - Audio files hosted on GitHub Codespaces may have cross-origin restrictions
3. **Network Loading** - Audio files may not be fully loaded when play() is called
4. **Codec Support** - Some browsers may have issues with `.ogg` files

### Enhanced Error Logging

Added better diagnostics to pinpoint the exact failure:

**manifest.ts**:
- Now logs when no variants are found for a key
- Helps identify typos or missing audio keys

**AudioManager.ts**:
- Wrapped entire `play()` method in try-catch
- Logs exact error location and details
- Prevents promise rejections from bubbling up

### Testing the Fix

1. **Check Console** - You should now see detailed warnings instead of crashes:
   - `[AudioManifest] No variants found...` = Missing audio key
   - `[AudioManager] No variant available...` = pickAudioVariant returned null
   - `[AudioManager] Failed to play clip...` = HTMLAudioElement.play() failed
   - `[AudioManager] Error in play()...` = Unexpected error in async chain
   - `[Game] Failed to play audio...` = Top-level catch (last resort)

2. **Game Should Continue** - Even if audio fails, construction should work normally

3. **No More Unhandled Rejections** - The game won't spam error messages

### Next Steps

If audio still isn't playing:

1. **Check Browser Console** for the enhanced error messages
2. **User Interaction** - Click on the game canvas before construction starts (bypasses autoplay restrictions)
3. **Check Network Tab** - Verify `.ogg` files are loading successfully
4. **Try Different Browser** - Firefox, Chrome, Safari may have different audio support

### Technical Details

**Error Handling Chain**:
```
Construction Audio Attempt
  ↓
game.playAudio(key, options)
  ↓
audioManager.play(key, options) [wrapped in try-catch]
  ↓
pickAudioVariant(key) [returns null if missing]
  ↓
prepareClip(variant.file) [may fail on network/CORS]
  ↓
element.play() [may fail on autoplay restrictions]
  ↓
Promise rejection caught by Game.playAudio().catch()
  ↓
Warning logged to console
  ↓
Game continues normally ✅
```

### Files Modified
- `src/game/Game.ts` - Added `.catch()` to playAudio()
- `src/assets/audio/manifest.ts` - Added warning when no variants found
- `src/game/audio/AudioManager.ts` - Added try-catch wrapper and detailed logging

---

**Status**: The game is now resilient to audio failures and will continue running even if sounds don't play.
