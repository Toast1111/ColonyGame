# Work Priority Panel - Modal Implementation

## Problem Solved

The work priority panel was not behaving as a **modal dialog**. Users could:
- ❌ Click on other UI elements while the panel was open
- ❌ Place buildings by clicking through the panel
- ❌ Interact with the game world while managing priorities
- ❌ Use hotkeys that affected gameplay

This broke the "single level of interaction" principle - when a modal is open, **only that modal should be interactive**.

## Solution: True Modal Behavior

The panel now implements proper modal behavior by **blocking ALL game interactions** when open.

### Implementation

#### 1. Mouse Click Blocking (mousedown)
```typescript
c.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  // PRIORITY PANEL IS MODAL - Check first and block all other interactions
  if (isWorkPriorityPanelOpen()) {
    if (handleWorkPriorityPanelClick(e.offsetX * this.DPR, e.offsetY * this.DPR, ...)) {
      return; // Panel handled the click
    }
    // If panel is open but click wasn't handled, still block everything else
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal game interactions only if panel is closed
  // ...
});
```

#### 2. Touch Event Blocking (handleTapOrClickAtScreen)
```typescript
handleTapOrClickAtScreen(sx: number, sy: number) {
  // PRIORITY PANEL IS MODAL - Check first and block all other interactions
  if (isWorkPriorityPanelOpen()) {
    if (handleWorkPriorityPanelClick(sx * this.DPR, sy * this.DPR, ...)) {
      return; // Panel handled the click
    }
    // If panel is open but click wasn't handled, still block everything else
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal touch interactions only if panel is closed
  // ...
}
```

#### 3. Mouse Movement Blocking (mousemove)
```typescript
c.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  // Update mouse position for cursor tracking
  this.mouse.x = (e.clientX - rect.left);
  this.mouse.y = (e.clientY - rect.top);
  
  // PRIORITY PANEL IS MODAL - Block world interactions when open
  if (isWorkPriorityPanelOpen()) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal drag/paint interactions only if panel is closed
  // ...
});
```

#### 4. Mouse Wheel/Scroll Hijacking (wheel)
```typescript
c.addEventListener('wheel', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // PRIORITY PANEL IS MODAL - Use wheel for scrolling panel when open
  if (isWorkPriorityPanelOpen()) {
    handleWorkPriorityPanelScroll(e.deltaY);
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal zoom only if panel is closed
  // ...
});
```

#### 5. Keyboard Input Blocking (update)
```typescript
update(dt: number) {
  // PRIORITY PANEL IS MODAL - Only allow 'P' and 'Escape' to close it
  const priorityPanelOpen = isWorkPriorityPanelOpen();
  if (priorityPanelOpen) {
    if (this.keyPressed('p')) { 
      toggleWorkPriorityPanel(); 
      this.toast('Work Priorities Panel closed'); 
    }
    if (this.keyPressed('escape')) { 
      toggleWorkPriorityPanel(); 
      this.toast('Work Priorities Panel closed'); 
    }
    // Block ALL other inputs when panel is open
    return;
  }
  
  // Normal hotkeys only if panel is closed
  // ...
}
```

#### 6. Click Outside to Close
```typescript
// In workPriorityPanel.ts - handleWorkPriorityPanelClick()
if (mouseX < panelX || mouseX > panelX + panelWidth ||
    mouseY < panelY || mouseY > panelY + panelHeight) {
  // Click outside panel - close it
  closeWorkPriorityPanel();
  return true; // Click was handled (closed the panel)
}
```

## What's Blocked When Panel is Open

### ✅ Blocked Interactions
1. **Building placement** - Can't place buildings
2. **Colonist selection** - Can't select colonists  
3. **Context menus** - Can't open right-click menus
4. **Build menu** - Can't open/interact with build menu (B key)
5. **Camera movement** - WASD keys disabled
6. **Camera zoom** - +/- keys and mouse wheel redirected to panel scroll
7. **Hotbar selection** - Number keys (1-9) disabled
8. **Floor/path painting** - Drag-to-paint disabled
9. **Ghost building movement** - Pending placement disabled
10. **Colonist panel** - Other UI panels blocked
11. **Fast-forward toggle** - F key disabled
12. **Pause toggle** - Space bar disabled
13. **Debug toggles** - G, J, K, R, T keys disabled

### ✅ Allowed Interactions (Panel Only)
1. **Click cells** - Cycle work priorities
2. **Click close button** - Close panel with X
3. **Click outside** - Close panel by clicking backdrop
4. **Press P key** - Close panel
5. **Press Escape key** - Close panel
6. **Mouse wheel** - Scroll panel content

## Drawing Order

The panel is drawn **LAST** in the render pipeline, ensuring it appears on top of:
- World objects (buildings, colonists, trees, rocks)
- Particles and effects
- Night overlay
- Ghost building preview
- Erase rectangle
- HUD elements
- Build menu
- Colonist profile
- Context menus

```typescript
// In Game.ts draw() method - drawing order:
ctx.restore(); // End world transform

// UI Layer (screen space)
drawHUD(...);
drawColonistProfileUI(...);
drawBuildMenuUI(...);
drawPlacementUIUI(...);
drawContextMenuUI(...);

// MODAL LAYER (topmost)
drawWorkPriorityPanel(...); // ← Always on top!
```

## Result

✅ **True modal behavior** - Only the panel is interactive when open  
✅ **No accidental interactions** - Game world completely blocked  
✅ **Proper z-index** - Panel drawn on top of everything  
✅ **Multiple close methods** - X button, outside click, P key, Escape key  
✅ **Scroll support** - Mouse wheel scrolls panel content  
✅ **Professional UX** - Matches standard modal dialog patterns  

## User Experience

When the player opens the work priority panel (P key):
1. **Backdrop darkens** - Semi-transparent overlay
2. **Panel appears centered** - Modal dialog on top
3. **Game freezes** - All world interactions blocked
4. **Only panel works** - Can click cells, scroll, close
5. **Easy to close** - P, Escape, X button, or click outside

This creates a clear "mode" where the player is **managing work priorities** and nothing else - exactly like RimWorld and other professional colony sims!
