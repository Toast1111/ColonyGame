# Work Priority Panel Z-Index Fix

## Problem
Mobile control buttons (Build Menu, Deselect, Erase, Fast Forward, Pause) were appearing on top of the work priority panel modal overlay, breaking the intended UX.

## Root Cause
The work priority panel is rendered on the **canvas element**, while the mobile controls are **HTML buttons** with CSS `z-index: 10`. In the DOM stacking context:
- Canvas layer: z-index 0 (default)
- Mobile controls: z-index 10

HTML elements with higher z-index always render above canvas content, regardless of render order.

## Solution
Hide the mobile control buttons when the work priority panel is open, and restore them when closed.

### Changes Made

**`src/game/ui/workPriorityPanel.ts`**

1. **Updated `toggleWorkPriorityPanel()`**:
   ```typescript
   export function toggleWorkPriorityPanel(): void {
     isPanelOpen = !isPanelOpen;
     panelScrollY = 0;
     
     // Hide/show mobile controls to prevent z-index overlay
     const mobileControls = document.getElementById('mobileControls');
     if (mobileControls) {
       mobileControls.style.display = isPanelOpen ? 'none' : '';
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Updated `closeWorkPriorityPanel()`**:
   ```typescript
   export function closeWorkPriorityPanel(): void {
     isPanelOpen = false;
     
     // Restore mobile controls visibility
     const mobileControls = document.getElementById('mobileControls');
     if (mobileControls) {
       mobileControls.style.display = '';
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Added canvas state management to `drawWorkPriorityPanel()`**:
   - Added `ctx.save()` at the beginning
   - Added `ctx.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)` to reset transforms
   - Added `ctx.restore()` at the end
   
   This ensures the panel renders with a clean canvas state, preventing any world transforms or clipping regions from previous draws from interfering.

## Result
‚úÖ Work priority panel now renders as a true modal overlay
‚úÖ Mobile control buttons are hidden when panel is open
‚úÖ Full-screen semi-transparent backdrop works correctly
‚úÖ No z-index conflicts between HTML and canvas layers
‚úÖ Buttons automatically restore when panel closes

## Testing
1. Open work priority panel (press **P**)
2. Verify mobile controls (üèóÔ∏è ‚úñÔ∏è üßπ ‚èØÔ∏è ‚è©) disappear
3. Verify panel backdrop covers entire screen
4. Close panel (press **P**, **Escape**, click **X**, or click outside)
5. Verify mobile controls reappear

Works correctly on:
- Desktop (buttons remain hidden as they're only shown on mobile)
- Mobile/tablet (buttons properly hide/show with panel state)
- All screen sizes and DPR settings
