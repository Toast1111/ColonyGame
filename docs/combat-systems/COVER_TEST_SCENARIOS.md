/**
 * Cover Mechanics Test Scenarios
 * 
 * These scenarios can be used to manually test the cover system in-game
 */

// Scenario 1: Wall Cover
// Setup:
// 1. Build a wall
// 2. Position a colonist adjacent to the wall
// 3. Spawn an enemy on the opposite side of the wall
// Expected: Colonist leans out and fires with full accuracy; enemy behind wall has 25% hit chance (75% cover)

// Scenario 2: Stone Chunk Cover
// Setup:
// 1. Find a stone chunk (rock entity)
// 2. Position an enemy behind the stone chunk
// 3. Position a colonist to shoot at the enemy
// Expected: Enemy has 50% cover, reducing hit accuracy to 50% of normal

// Scenario 3: Tree Cover
// Setup:
// 1. Find a tree
// 2. Position an enemy behind the tree
// 3. Position a colonist to shoot at the enemy
// Expected: Enemy has 30% cover, reducing hit accuracy to 70% of normal

// Scenario 4: Multiple Cover Types
// Setup:
// 1. Position an enemy near both a tree and a stone chunk
// 2. Position a colonist to shoot at the enemy
// Expected: The higher cover value (stone chunk 50%) is used, not the tree (30%)

// Scenario 5: Enemy Using Defensive Lines
// Setup:
// 1. Build defensive walls
// 2. Allow enemies to advance and position behind your walls
// 3. Try to shoot the enemies
// Expected: Enemies benefit from 75% wall cover, making them hard to hit

// Scenario 6: Cover Seeking Behavior
// Setup:
// 1. Place stone chunks and trees around the map
// 2. Draft a colonist
// 3. Spawn enemies nearby
// Expected: Colonist automatically moves to positions adjacent to cover objects (prioritizing stone chunks and walls over trees)

// Testing Notes:
// - Cover applies when objects are within the last 25% of the shot path (near the target)
// - Adjacent cover objects provide partial cover even if not directly blocking
// - CombatManager evaluates cover positions and scores them for colonists to seek
// - Enemies passively benefit from cover without special AI
