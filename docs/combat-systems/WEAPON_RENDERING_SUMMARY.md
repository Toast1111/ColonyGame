# Weapon Rendering Implementation - Quick Summary

## What Was Added

A complete weapon rendering system that displays equipped weapons on colonists during combat, with automatic rotation towards their aim target.

## Key Features

✅ **7 Weapon Assets Loaded**: AssaultRifle, Autopistol, Revolver, Shotgun, SniperRifle, Club, Knife  
✅ **Automatic Display**: Weapons appear when colonists are drafted or aiming  
✅ **Dynamic Rotation**: Weapons rotate smoothly to face the colonist's target  
✅ **Smart Flipping**: Weapons flip to prevent upside-down appearance when aiming left  
✅ **Proper Positioning**: Weapons positioned at hand/chest level with grip-point anchoring  

## Files Modified

1. **`src/assets/images.ts`**
   - Added weapon asset imports and loading
   - Added `getWeaponImage(defName)` method

2. **`src/game/types.ts`**
   - Added `aimTarget`, `aimAngle`, `isAiming` to Colonist type

3. **`src/game/combat/pawnCombat.ts`**
   - Updates aim data when colonists acquire/engage targets
   - Sets `isAiming` flag for drafted colonists

4. **`src/game/ui/weaponRenderer.ts`** (NEW)
   - Main weapon rendering logic
   - Handles rotation, positioning, and flipping

5. **`src/game/ui/colonistRenderer.ts`**
   - Integrates weapon rendering into colonist avatar drawing
   - Calls `drawWeapon()` after sprite layers

## How It Works

```
Combat Update → Set aimTarget/aimAngle → Renderer draws weapon rotated → Visual feedback
```

1. **Combat System**: Tracks what colonists are aiming at, updates `aimAngle`
2. **Weapon Renderer**: Draws weapon sprite rotated by `aimAngle`
3. **Colonist Renderer**: Integrates weapon into colonist sprite composition

## Testing

1. **Draft a colonist** (press 'R' or use draft button)
2. **Ensure they have a weapon equipped** 
3. **Position near enemies** or assign a target
4. **Weapon should appear and rotate** towards target

## What Players Will See

- When a colonist is drafted, their weapon becomes visible
- The weapon rotates smoothly to track their aim target
- Weapons stay properly oriented even when colonist faces left/right
- Clear visual feedback for combat state

## Integration with Existing Systems

- ✅ Works with existing colonist sprite system
- ✅ Respects drafted state from FSM
- ✅ Uses weapon from inventory/equipment system
- ✅ Integrates with combat target acquisition
- ✅ No changes needed to existing weapon stats or combat mechanics

## Performance

- Minimal overhead: only renders when `isAiming` or `isDrafted`
- Uses cached weapon images from ImageAssets singleton
- Single canvas draw call per weapon per frame
