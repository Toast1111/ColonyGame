# Building Placement While Paused - Quick Summary

## What Changed

✅ **You can now place ALL buildings while the game is paused**, not just walls and paths.

## The Fix

**One line removed** from `/src/game/placement/placementSystem.ts`:

```diff
export function placeAtMouse(game: Game) {
- if (game.paused) return;  // ❌ Removed this line
  const t = game.selectedBuild;
  // ... rest of placement logic
```

## Why This Matters

**Before**: Could only place walls and paths while paused (inconsistent UX)  
**After**: Can place any building while paused (RimWorld-style colony planning)

## How to Test

1. Press **Spacebar** to pause the game
2. Select any building (press `1-9` or use build menu)
3. Click on the map to place it
4. **Result**: Blueprint appears immediately
5. Unpause the game
6. **Result**: Colonists walk to blueprint and start building

## What Still Works

- ✅ Resource validation (can't place without materials)
- ✅ Collision detection (can't place on top of other buildings)
- ✅ Pathfinding updates (blueprint blocks movement)
- ✅ Touch/mobile placement workflow

## What's Blocked While Paused (Correctly)

- ❌ Construction progress (colonists frozen)
- ❌ Resource gathering (colonists frozen)
- ❌ Combat (time stopped)
- ❌ Any colonist/enemy movement

## Design Philosophy

**Planning ≠ Execution**

- Placing a blueprint = instant planning action ✅ (works while paused)
- Building the blueprint = time-based work ❌ (blocked while paused)

This matches RimWorld's core gameplay: **pause → plan → unpause → execute**.
