# Mobile Placement UI - Quick Test Guide

## How to Test the Cancel Button Fix

### Setup
1. Open the game at `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Start a new game or load existing save

### Test Procedure

#### Test 1: Basic Cancel Functionality
1. **Tap** any building in the hotbar (e.g., House, Farm, Turret)
2. The **precise placement UI** should appear with:
   - Ghost preview of the building
   - Arrow buttons (↑ ↓ ← →)
   - Rotation buttons (⟲ ⟳)
   - Cancel button (✕)
   - Confirm button (✓)
3. **Tap the ✕ button**
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ Ghost preview disappears
   - ✅ All UI buttons disappear
   - ✅ Return to normal game mode
   - ✅ No lingering UI elements

#### Test 2: Cancel After Nudging
1. Tap a building from hotbar
2. Use arrow buttons to move the ghost around
3. Tap the ✕ button
4. **Expected Result**: Everything clears properly

#### Test 3: Cancel After Rotating
1. Tap a building from hotbar
2. Use rotation buttons (⟲ ⟳)
3. Tap the ✕ button
4. **Expected Result**: Everything clears properly

#### Test 4: Confirm Button (Should Also Work)
1. Tap a building from hotbar
2. Move to a valid location (blue ghost)
3. Tap the ✓ button
4. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Building is placed
   - ✅ Resources are deducted
   - ✅ UI clears properly

#### Test 5: Desktop Mode (Mouse)
1. On desktop, click a building in hotbar
2. The placement UI should appear
3. Click the ✕ button with mouse
4. **Expected Result**: Same as touch - everything clears

#### Test 6: Invalid Placement Cancel
1. Tap a building from hotbar
2. Move ghost to invalid location (red ghost - e.g., overlapping another building)
3. Tap the ✕ button
4. **Expected Result**: Everything clears (even though placement was invalid)

### What to Look For

#### ✅ Success Indicators
- Ghost disappears immediately on cancel
- All buttons disappear
- Can place another building after cancel
- No console errors
- No visual artifacts

#### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Ghost remains visible
- Buttons remain on screen
- Can't place new buildings
- Console shows errors
- UI gets stuck

### Common Issues (Now Fixed)

**Before the fix:**
- ❌ Cancel button would clear `pendingPlacement` but leave `placeUIRects`
- ❌ UI buttons would remain on screen
- ❌ Ghost might still be visible
- ❌ Next placement attempt would fail

**After the fix:**
- ✅ Cancel properly clears all state
- ✅ Both `pendingPlacement` and `placeUIRects` are cleared
- ✅ UIManager state is synchronized
- ✅ Clean return to normal mode

### Browser Console Testing

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check initial state
console.log('Pending:', game.pendingPlacement);
console.log('UI Rects:', game.placeUIRects);

// After tapping a building
// Should see:
// Pending: { key: 'house', x: ..., y: ..., rot: 0 }
// UI Rects: [{ id: 'up', x: ..., y: ..., w: 42, h: 42 }, ...]

// After clicking cancel
// Should see:
// Pending: null
// UI Rects: []
```

### Mobile Device Testing

#### On Phone/Tablet
1. Open `http://<your-ip>:5173/` on mobile device
2. Tap a building
3. UI should be large enough for finger taps
4. Test cancel button with finger
5. Everything should clear properly

#### Touch Events
- Single tap on ✕ should cancel
- No need for long press
- Immediate response

### Performance Check

- No memory leaks after multiple cancel/place cycles
- UI remains responsive
- No performance degradation

## Regression Testing

Make sure we didn't break anything:

1. **Nudge buttons still work** (↑ ↓ ← →)
2. **Rotation buttons still work** (⟲ ⟳)
3. **Confirm button still works** (✓)
4. **Ghost dragging still works** (tap and drag)
5. **Tap ghost to confirm** still works
6. **Tap map to move ghost** still works

All other placement functionality should remain unchanged!

## Expected Build Info

```
✓ TypeScript compilation passes
✓ Vite build succeeds
✓ No console errors
✓ 138 modules transformed
```

## Quick Verification

**30-second test:**
1. Start game
2. Tap any building in hotbar
3. Tap ✕ button
4. ✅ Everything disappears? **PASS**
5. ❌ Anything remains? **FAIL** (but shouldn't happen now!)
