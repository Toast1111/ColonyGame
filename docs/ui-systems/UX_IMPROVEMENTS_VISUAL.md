# UX/UI Improvements - Visual Guide

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> "The UX design and UI design is very user unfriendly, both for PC and mobile. The biggest red flags are the context menus, drafting and combat, medical, and even the colonist bio with all of its tabs. Nothing feels good to use. Don't get me wrong, it all works, but it makes players frustrated."

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Context Menu Simplification

#### Before:
```
Context Menu (Right-click colonist)
├── Draft/Undraft
├── Prioritize ▶
│   ├── Medical Work
│   ├── Work Tasks
│   ├── Construction
│   ├── Hauling
│   └── Research
├── Force ▶
│   ├── Rest Now (disabled if not tired)
│   ├── Eat Now (disabled if not hungry)
│   ├── Work
│   └── Guard Area
├── Go To ▶
│   ├── HQ
│   ├── Safe Room
│   ├── Nearest Bed
│   └── Food Storage
├── Medical ▶
│   ├── (various options based on injuries)
│   └── ...
├── Cancel Current Task
└── Follow

❌ Problems:
- 4 nested submenus (too much nesting!)
- Critical actions hidden in submenus
- Small touch targets (32px)
- Important medical actions buried
```

#### After:
```
Context Menu (Right-click colonist)
├── 🎯 Draft for Combat (or ⚔️ Undraft)
├── 🚑 Rescue to Bed (if downed) ← URGENT, TOP LEVEL
├── 🩸 Bandage Bleeding (if bleeding) ← URGENT, TOP LEVEL
├── 🏥 Treat Injuries (if injured) ← URGENT, TOP LEVEL
├── 😴 Rest Now (if tired) ← VISIBLE WHEN NEEDED
├── 🍽️ Eat Now (if hungry) ← VISIBLE WHEN NEEDED
├── ⋯ More Actions ▶
│   ├── Set Priority ▶ (Medical, Work, Build, Haul)
│   ├── Send To... ▶ (Bed, Food, HQ, Safety)
│   └── More Medical... ▶ (if multiple options)
├── ❌ Cancel Task (if has task)
└── 👁️ Follow Camera

✅ Improvements:
- Critical actions at top level (1 click!)
- Context-sensitive (only show what's relevant)
- Larger touch targets (36px)
- Better visual hierarchy with emojis
```

### 2. Colonist Profile Tab Persistence

#### Before:
```
User workflow:
1. Click Colonist A → Opens to "Bio" tab
2. Switch to "Health" tab → See injury info
3. Click Colonist B → RESETS TO "Bio" tab 😡
4. Click "Health" tab again (annoying!)
5. Click Colonist C → RESETS TO "Bio" tab 😡
6. Click "Health" tab again (very annoying!!)

❌ Problem: Tab resets every time = frustrating repetitive clicking
```

#### After:
```
User workflow:
1. Click Colonist A → Opens to "Bio" tab
2. Switch to "Health" tab → See injury info
3. Click Colonist B → Opens to "Health" tab ✨
4. (No extra clicking needed!)
5. Click Colonist C → Opens to "Health" tab ✨
6. (Still no extra clicking!)

✅ Improvement: Tab persists across colonist switches
```

---

### 3. Medical Visual Indicators

#### Before:
```
[Colonist sprite on map]
    (no visual indication of injuries)

❌ Problem: Can't tell if colonist is injured without clicking
```

#### After:
```
[Colonist sprite on map]
         🤕  ← Amber pulsing icon (general injury)
         
[Bleeding colonist sprite]
         🩸  ← Red pulsing icon (bleeding - urgent!)
         
[Downed colonist sprite]
         💀  ← Dark red pulsing icon (critical!)

✅ Improvement: Injuries visible at a glance across entire map
```

---

### 4. Drafted Colonist Indicator

#### Before:
```
[Colonist sprite]
  ↑ (small green shield, easy to miss)

❌ Problem: Hard to tell which colonists are drafted
```

#### After:
```
    [Green background circle]
         🛡️  ← Larger shield icon
    [Colonist sprite]
       DRAFTED  ← Bold green text label

✅ Improvement: Drafted status unmistakable
```

---

### 5. Colonist Hover Tooltips

#### Before:
```
(Hover over colonist)
→ Nothing happens

❌ Problem: Must click to see any info
```

#### After:
```
(Hover over colonist)
→ ╔══════════════════════════╗

---

### 6. Enhanced Tab Styling

#### Before:
```
┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│ Bio  │Health│ Gear │Social│Skills│ Log  │ ← Hard to tell which is active
└──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
(Subtle difference between active/inactive)

❌ Problem: Active tab not obvious
```

#### After:
```
┌══════╗──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
║ Bio  ║Health│ Gear │Social│Skills│ Log  │ ← Active tab glows!
╚══════╝──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
(Bright blue border, glow effect, bold text)

✅ Improvement: Always know which tab is active
```

---

### 7. Work Priority Panel Instructions

║ [Complex grid...]      ║
║                        ║

(No explanation of how to use it)

❌ Problem: New players confused by grid
```

#### After:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   Work Priorities                         ║
║   Click cells to cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → ─ ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ [Complex grid...]                         ║
║                                           ║
