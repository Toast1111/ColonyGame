# Construction Audio System - Quick Reference

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Looping construction sounds** while colonists actively build structures  
✅ **Material-aware audio** - stone buildings use stone hammer sounds, wood buildings use wood sounds  
✅ **Random variant selection** - each loop plays a different audio clip for natural variety  
✅ **Completion sounds** - satisfying "done" audio when building finishes  
✅ **Automatic cleanup** - audio tracking cleared when colonist stops building  
✅ **Property-driven design** - based on building category/type, NOT hardcoded names

---

## How It Works

### 1. While Building
- Colonist reaches building site
- Every **1.5-2 seconds**, a construction sound plays
- Sound selection based on building material:
  - **Stone buildings** (walls, turrets) → `hammer_stone` sounds (5 variants)
  - **Wood buildings** (houses, beds) → `hammer_pin_wood` sounds (6 variants)
  - **Metal buildings** (stoves, turrets) → Heavy industrial sounds
  - **Special** (warehouse) → Circular saw sounds (6 variants)

### 2. When Construction Completes
- Building reaches `buildLeft <= 0`
- **Completion sound plays** (higher volume 0.85)
  - Stone buildings → Heavy stone drop sound
  - Wood buildings → Wood placement sounds (4 variants)
- Audio tracking automatically cleared

### 3. If Building is Abandoned
- Colonist gets reassigned, times out, or building is deleted
- Audio tracking immediately cleared
- No lingering sounds

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified

1. **`src/game/types.ts`** - Added audio tracking properties to Colonist:
   ```typescript
   lastConstructionAudioTime?: number;
   activeConstructionAudio?: string;
   ```

2. **`src/game/audio/buildingAudioMap.ts`** - Added helper functions:
   ```typescript
   getConstructionAudio(buildingKey, buildingDef)
   getConstructionCompleteAudio(buildingKey, buildingDef)
   ```

3. **`src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`** - Added audio logic in `'build'` state:
   - Import construction audio functions
   - Play construction loop audio (lines ~1368-1396)
   - Play completion audio (lines ~1397-1406)
   - Clear audio tracking on abandonment (lines ~1329, ~1344)

## Testing Quick Guide

### In-Game Test (Recommended)

1. Press **backtick (`)** to open debug console
2. Run: `resources unlimited`
3. Place a **wall** (stone building)
4. Listen for **hammer-on-stone sounds** every 1.5-2 seconds
5. Wait for completion → hear **stone drop sound**
6. Place a **house** (wood building)
7. Listen for **wood hammering sounds**
8. Place multiple buildings with multiple colonists → layered construction ambiance

### Expected Audio Examples

**Stone Wall Construction**:
- Loop: `Hammer_Stone_1a.ogg` → `Hammer_Stone_1c.ogg` → `Hammer_Stone_1e.ogg` (random)
- Complete: `StoneBlock_Drop_1a.ogg`

**Wooden House Construction**:
- Loop: `Hammer_Pin_Wood_1a.ogg` → `Hammer_Pin_Wood_1d.ogg` → `Hammer_Pin_Wood_1b.ogg` (random)
- Complete: `Place_Wood_1c.ogg`

**Large Warehouse Construction**:
- Loop: `Wood_Saw_Circular_1a.ogg` → `Wood_Saw_Circular_1f.ogg` (power saw sounds)
- Complete: `Place_Wood_1a.ogg`

## Adding New Buildings

**No audio code changes required!** The system is property-driven.

### Example: New "Barricade" Building

```typescript
// In buildings.ts
barricade: {
  category: 'Defense',  // ← This determines construction audio!
  name: 'Barricade',
  cost: { wood: 10, stone: 5 },
  hp: 150,
  size: { w: 2, h: 1 },
  build: 60,
  color: '#8B7355'
}
```

**Automatic behavior**:
- Construction: Stone hammer sounds (Defense category default)
- Completion: Stone drop sound
- **Zero audio code changes!**

### Custom Audio (Optional)

Only if you want different sounds than category default:

```typescript
// In buildingAudioMap.ts BUILDING_AUDIO_OVERRIDES
barricade: {
  placement: 'buildings.placement.confirm',
  constructionLoop: 'buildings.construct.wood.rummage', // Custom!
  complete: 'buildings.construct.wood.finish'
}
```

## Audio Volume Levels

| Audio Type | Volume | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Construction Loop | 0.75 | Audible but not overpowering during gameplay |
| Completion Sound | 0.85 | Louder for satisfying feedback |
| Category | `buildings` | Controlled by buildings volume slider |

---

## Troubleshooting

**No audio while building?**
- Check volume settings (master + buildings category)
- Verify building has valid `kind` in `BUILD_TYPES`
- Open browser console - any AudioManager errors?

**Audio plays too often (spam)?**
- Should be 1.5-2 seconds between plays
- Check `c.lastConstructionAudioTime` is updating

**Audio doesn't stop when colonist leaves?**
- Check cleanup code runs (look for `undefined` assignments)
- Verify all exit paths clear audio tracking

**Same sound repeats (no variety)?**
- Verify `rng: Math.random()` is passed to playAudio()
- Check manifest has multiple variants (3+ for most construction sounds)

## Performance

**With 10 colonists building**:
- ~5-6 audio plays per second total
- 40+ different audio files cycling
- Audio files cached (no re-loading)
- Memory usage: ~2-5 MB for decoded buffers

**No performance impact** - construction audio integrated seamlessly with existing systems.
