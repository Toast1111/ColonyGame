# Building Inventory System - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Complete building inventory system** allowing farms, pantries, warehouses, and other storage buildings to hold items internally.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Inventory UI**
   - Right-click any building with storage → "View Inventory"
   - Beautiful modal panel showing items, quantities, and capacity
   - Works on desktop and mobile

2. **Automated Storage**
   - Farms store harvested wheat (up to 5 stacks of 100 each)
   - Pantries store bread from cooking (up to 10 stacks of 50 each)
   - Overflow automatically goes to global storage

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Item icons (emojis) for easy identification
   - Color-coded progress bars (green → orange → red)
   - Slot usage display (e.g., "3/10 slots used")

## How to Use

**As a Player:**
1. Build a farm or pantry
2. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) on the building
3. Select "View Inventory" from context menu
4. See what's stored inside!

**As a Developer:**
```typescript
import { addItemToInventory, getInventoryItemCount } from './game/systems/buildingInventory';

// Add items
const added = addItemToInventory(building, 'wheat', 50);

// Check quantity
const count = getInventoryItemCount(building, 'wheat');
```

## Files Changed/Created

**New Files:**
- `src/game/systems/buildingInventory.ts` - Inventory management logic
- `src/game/ui/buildingInventoryPanel.ts` - UI panel for viewing inventory
- `src/game/ui/contextMenus/buildings/providers/inventory.ts` - Context menu integration
- `docs/BUILDING_INVENTORY_SYSTEM.md` - Full documentation

**Modified Files:**
- `src/game/types.ts` - Added `BuildingInventory` interface
- `src/game/buildings.ts` - Auto-initialize inventory on building creation
- `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts` - Farm harvest and bread storage now use inventory
- `src/game/managers/RenderManager.ts` - Render inventory panel
- `src/game/Game.ts` - Handle inventory panel clicks/interactions

## Future Work (Optional)

The item 6 in the todo ("Add colonist hauling integration") is marked as not-started. This would involve:
- Creating a hauling job system for colonists to move items from farm inventories to warehouses
- Adding work priorities for hauling tasks
- Creating pathfinding logic for item transport

This can be implemented later as an enhancement. The current system is fully functional without it - items simply overflow to global storage when building inventories are full.

## Testing

The system has been built successfully and is ready to test. To verify:

1. Start the dev server (already running)
2. Build a farm and wait for harvest
3. Right-click the farm and view inventory
4. See wheat stored in the farm
5. Build a pantry and cook bread
6. Right-click pantry and see bread stored
