# Cover Mechanics Implementation - Summary

## Issue Requirements
Implement Part 2 of the colonist combat system with refined cover mechanics:
1. ✅ High cover (walls) vs low cover (sandbags, rocks, trees) differentiation
2. ✅ Directional cover effectiveness based on attack angle (100% frontal → 0% flanked)
3. ✅ Distance-based cover reduction (33.33% point-blank → 100% at 2+ tiles)
4. ✅ Multiple cover sources can combine for diagonal protection
5. ✅ Cover from specific angles with angle-based multipliers
6. ✅ Natural cover (trees, rocks) vs artificial cover (walls, planned sandbags)

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

#### 1. `src/game/combat/pawnCombat.ts`
- **Added** `getDirectionalCoverMultiplier(angle)`: Calculates cover effectiveness based on attack angle
  - < 15° → 100% effectiveness (frontal)
  - 15-27° → 80% effectiveness
  - 27-40° → 60% effectiveness
  - 40-52° → 40% effectiveness
  - 52-65° → 20% effectiveness
  - > 65° → 0% effectiveness (flanked)

- **Added** `getDistanceCoverMultiplier(distance)`: Calculates cover effectiveness based on distance
  - < 0.5 tiles → 33.33% effectiveness (point-blank)
  - 1 tile → 66.666% effectiveness
  - 2+ tiles → 100% effectiveness (full)

- **Rewrote** `coverPenalty()` function with advanced mechanics:
  - Tracks multiple cover sources with effectiveness calculations
  - Distinguishes high cover (walls - 75%) from low cover (rocks/trees - 30-50%)
  - Applies directional and distance modifiers to base cover values
  - High cover takes precedence; low cover can combine (primary + 20% × additional)
  - Final cover capped at 90% to ensure some shots can hit

#### 2. `src/game/combat/combatManager.ts`
- **Added** private methods for cover calculations:
  - `getDirectionalCoverMultiplier(angle)`: Same directional logic as pawnCombat
  - `getDistanceCoverMultiplier(distance)`: Same distance logic as pawnCombat

- **Rewrote** `getCoverValueAtPosition()` with refined mechanics:
  - Calculates shot direction from threat to position
  - For each cover piece:
    - Computes angle between shot direction and cover facing
    - Applies directional multiplier
    - Applies distance multiplier
    - Calculates effective cover value
  - High cover (walls) takes precedence
  - Low cover sources can combine (primary + 20% of secondary/tertiary)
  - Position scoring now accounts for directional effectiveness

### Cover Types Implemented

| Type | Base Value | Category | Can Shoot Over | Directional | Distance-Based |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Walls | 75% | High | No | ✅ | ✅ |
| Stone Chunks | 50% | Low | Yes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Trees | 30% | Low | Yes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sandbags* | 45% | Low | Yes | ✅ | ✅ |

*Planned feature - system ready to support

### How It Works

#### Shooting Mechanics
1. Calculate shot vector from shooter to target
2. For each cover object in last 25% of shot path:
   - Calculate base cover value (30%, 50%, or 75%)
   - Compute attack angle relative to cover facing
   - Apply directional multiplier (0-100% based on angle)
   - Compute shooter-to-cover distance
   - Apply distance multiplier (33.33-100% based on distance)
   - Calculate effective cover: `base × directional × distance`
3. High cover (walls) takes precedence
4. Low cover sources combine: `primary + (secondary × 0.2) + (tertiary × 0.2)`
5. Final accuracy: `baseAccuracy × distanceFactor × (1 - effectiveCover)`

#### Example Calculations

**Scenario 1: Wall, Frontal, 3 tiles**
- Base: 75%
- Angle: 10° → 100% directional
- Distance: 3 tiles → 100% distance
- Effective: 75% × 100% × 100% = **75% cover penalty**

**Scenario 2: Wall, Flanked (70°)**
- Base: 75%
- Angle: 70° → 0% directional
- Distance: 3 tiles → 100% distance
- Effective: 75% × 0% × 100% = **0% cover penalty** (no protection!)

**Scenario 3: Rock, Point-Blank**
- Base: 50%
- Angle: 10° → 100% directional
- Distance: 0.3 tiles → 33.33% distance
- Effective: 50% × 100% × 33.33% = **16.7% cover penalty**

**Scenario 4: Multiple Rocks, Diagonal**
- Rock 1: 50% × 60% (angle) × 100% (dist) = 30%
- Rock 2: 50% × 40% (angle) × 100% (dist) = 20% × 0.2 = 4%
- Total: 30% + 4% = **34% cover penalty**

#### Cover Seeking
1. `CombatManager` evaluates nearby cover objects
2. Calculates positions around each cover object
3. For each position:
   - Determines optimal facing angle toward threat
   - Calculates directional effectiveness
   - Applies distance modifier
   - Computes effective cover value
4. Scores positions: effective cover (70%) + distance from threat (30%)
5. Colonist moves to best tactical position

#### Enemy Usage
- Enemies automatically benefit from refined cover system
- Same directional and distance rules apply
- Flanking enemies from sides (>65°) negates their cover
- Closing distance reduces their cover effectiveness
- Defensive lines can be used against you if enemies advance

## Tactical Implications

### Offensive Tactics
- **Flank for Success**: Attack from >65° angle to negate cover completely
- **Close the Distance**: Point-blank attacks reduce cover to 33% effectiveness
- **Focus Fire**: Target poorly positioned or flanked enemies
- **Avoid Frontal Assaults**: Well-positioned defenders behind cover are very hard to hit

### Defensive Tactics
- **Face the Threat**: Position to get 0-15° angle for maximum cover
- **Maintain Distance**: Keep 2+ tiles from enemies for full cover effectiveness
- **Use Walls Wisely**: Best protection (75%) but blocks line of sight
- **Layer Cover**: Multiple low cover pieces provide diagonal protection

## Testing

### Manual Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Directional Effectiveness
**Setup**: Colonist behind wall, enemy at various angles
- 0° frontal: Expect 75% cover (25% accuracy)
- 20° angle: Expect 60% cover (40% accuracy)
- 50° wide: Expect 30% cover (70% accuracy)
- 70° flank: Expect 0% cover (100% accuracy)

#### Test 2: Distance-Based Reduction
**Setup**: Colonist behind rock, enemy at various distances
- Point-blank (< 0.5 tiles): Expect ~17% cover
- 1 tile away: Expect ~33% cover
- 2+ tiles away: Expect 50% cover (full)

#### Test 3: Multiple Cover Sources
**Setup**: 2-3 rocks in diagonal line, enemy shooting through
- Should see combined cover (primary + 20% × secondary)
- Example: 30% + 6% = 36% total cover penalty

#### Test 4: Flanking Negation
**Setup**: Well-defended position with walls
- Frontal attack: Very hard to hit (75% cover)
- Flanking attack (>65°): Normal accuracy (0% cover)
