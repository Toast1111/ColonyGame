# Combat System Overhaul - Complete Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Body Part Health System Updates
- **Head HP**: Changed from 40 → **10 HP** (brain damage is critical)
- **Torso HP**: Changed from 80 → **40 HP** (general body/heart)
- Arms: 30 HP each (unchanged)
- Legs: 35 HP each (unchanged)

**Impact**: Combat is now more lethal, headshots are devastating, torso shots are dangerous but survivable.

### 2. Advanced Weapon Stats System

#### New Weapon Properties
All weapons now support:

1. **Damage** - Base damage per bullet
2. **Armor Penetration** (0-1) - Directly subtracts from armor rating
3. **Stopping Power** - Value >= 1 can stagger (reduce speed to 1/6th for 1.58s)
4. **Burst Count** - Number of bullets per trigger pull
5. **Aim Time** - Warmup before shooting (requires stationary)
6. **Cooldown Time** - Delay after shooting before next burst
7. **Range-Based Accuracy**:
   - Touch (3 tiles)
   - Short (12 tiles)
   - Medium (25 tiles)
   - Long (40 tiles)
   - Linear interpolation between breakpoints

#### Weapon Definitions

| Weapon | Damage | Range | Burst | AP | SP | Optimal DPS |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|----|----|-------------|
| Pistol | 12 | 25 | 1 | 15% | 0.8 | 13.33 |
| Rifle | 15 | 45 | 3 | 25% | 1.2 ✓ | 32.14 |
| Sniper | 35 | 60 | 1 | 50% | 2.0 ✓ | 12.96 |
| SMG | 8 | 20 | 5 | 10% | 0.7 | 36.36 |
| Knife | 15 | 1 | 1 | 10% | 0.5 | 18.75 |

✓ = Can stagger enemies

### 3. Combat Mechanics Implementation

#### Accuracy Interpolation
- Smooth accuracy scaling based on distance
- Each weapon has unique accuracy curve
- Example: Sniper poor at close (30%), excellent at long (95%)
- Formula: Linear interpolation between defined breakpoints

#### Armor Penetration System
```typescript
effectiveArmor = max(0, armorRating - armorPenetration)
damageDealt = damage × (1 - effectiveArmor)
```

Example:
- Rifle (15 dmg, 25% AP) vs Flak Vest (30% armor)
- Effective armor: 30% - 25% = 5%
- Damage dealt: 15 × 95% = 14 damage

#### Stopping Power (Stagger)
- Weapons with SP >= 1 can stagger targets
- Effect: Speed reduced to 1/6th for 95 ticks (1.58 seconds)
- Applied to both colonists and enemies
- Tactical use: Slow enemy advances, create escape opportunities

### 4. DPS Calculation System

#### Optimal DPS
Formula: `(damage × burstCount) / (aimTime + (burstCount - 1) × 0.1 + cooldownTime)`

Shows maximum theoretical damage if all shots hit.

#### DPS at Range
Formula: `OptimalDPS × AccuracyAtRange`

Shows realistic damage output at specific distances.

**Examples:**
- SMG at touch (3 tiles): 35.63 DPS (highest)
- Rifle at medium (25 tiles): 24.11 DPS (versatile)
- Sniper at long (40 tiles): 12.31 DPS (specialist)

### 5. Code Changes

## 🎮 Gameplay Impact

### Tactical Depth
- **Range matters**: Each weapon has optimal engagement distance
- **Armor counters**: High AP weapons counter heavy armor
- **Stagger tactics**: Control enemy movement with high SP weapons
- **Burst vs Single**: Trade-off between sustained fire and alpha damage

### Weapon Roles
- **Pistol**: Reliable backup, all-around performance
- **Rifle**: Main battle weapon, versatile and effective
- **Sniper**: Precision eliminator, long-range specialist
- **SMG**: Close-quarters dominator, highest DPS up close
- **Knife**: Melee last resort, always available

### Strategic Choices
- **Loadout composition**: Mix weapons for different ranges
- **Engagement distance**: Position based on weapon strengths
- **Target prioritization**: Use high AP weapons on armored targets
- **Movement control**: Use stagger to slow enemy advances

## 📊 Balance Analysis

### DPS by Range
```
Touch (3 tiles):   SMG > Rifle > Pistol > Sniper
Short (12 tiles):  Rifle ≈ SMG > Sniper > Pistol
Medium (25 tiles): Rifle > SMG > Sniper > Pistol
Long (40 tiles):   Rifle > Sniper > SMG > Pistol
```

### Armor Effectiveness
- **Flak Vest (30%)**: Reduced by most weapons
- **Tactical (50%)**: Only Sniper fully penetrates
- **Stagger Weapons**: Rifle and Sniper can control enemies

### Fire Rate vs Damage
- **High burst (SMG)**: 5 shots, low damage, fast
- **Medium burst (Rifle)**: 3 shots, medium damage, balanced
- **Single shot (Sniper/Pistol)**: 1 shot, varies by weapon
