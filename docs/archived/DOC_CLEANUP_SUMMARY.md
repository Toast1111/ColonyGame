# 📚 Documentation Cleanup - October 7, 2025

## ✅ Mission Accomplished!

Successfully cleaned up the documentation chaos and organized **60 markdown files** into a proper folder structure.

## Before & After

### Before 😱
```
Root directory: 14 documentation files cluttering the workspace
- REFACTORING_*.md
- UI_REFACTORING_*.md  
- WORK_PRIORITY_*.md
- Plus many more scattered around
```

### After 🎉
```
Root directory: 1 file (README.md - as it should be!)
docs/: 60 files organized into 10 categories

📁 docs/
├── 🔧 refactoring/         6 docs
├── 🎯 work-priority/       8 docs
├── 🏥 medical/            14 docs
├── 🗺️ navigation/          5 docs
├── 🌍 regions/             9 docs
├── 🧭 pathfinding/         4 docs
├── 🏔️ terrain/             4 docs

### Already Organized
Medical, navigation, regions, pathfinding, terrain, floor-system, door-system, and combat docs were already in their respective folders from previous work.

## How to Find Documentation

### Option 1: Browse by Category
```bash
# See all categories
ls docs/

# See refactoring docs
ls docs/refactoring/

# See medical docs
ls docs/medical/
```

### Option 2: Use the Index
Open `docs/README.md` for a comprehensive index with:
- Direct links to all major documents
- Description of each category
- Quick navigation by feature or task

### Option 3: Search by Name
```bash
# Find all "complete" guides
find docs -name "*COMPLETE*.md"

# Find all test guides  
find docs -name "*TEST*.md"

# Find refactoring docs
find docs -name "*REFACTORING*.md"
```
