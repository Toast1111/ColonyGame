# Cover Mechanics Implementation - Summary

## Issue Requirements
Implement Part 2 of the colonist combat system with cover mechanics:
1. ✅ Pawns should automatically use cover from adjacent sandbags and stone chunks
2. ✅ Walls provide 75% cover with "lean out" firing mechanics  
3. ✅ Enemies can use defensive lines as cover
4. ✅ Stone chunks are more effective than trees

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

#### 1. `src/game/combat/pawnCombat.ts`
- Enhanced `coverPenalty()` function to check walls, stone chunks, and trees
- Cover values implemented:
  - **Walls**: 75% (best cover, colonists lean out to fire)
  - **Stone chunks**: 50% (better than trees)
  - **Trees**: 30% (basic cover)
- Cover detection uses line-of-fire calculation
- Only considers cover within last 25% of shot path (near target)

#### 2. `src/game/combat/combatManager.ts`
- Updated `getCoverValueAtPosition()` to evaluate all cover types
- Enhanced `calculateCoverPositions()` to find cover from:
  - Walls (via `getPositionsAroundWall()`)
  - Stone chunks (via `getPositionsAroundCircle()`)
  - Trees (via `getPositionsAroundCircle()`)
- Added `getPositionsAroundCircle()` helper for circular cover objects
- Positions scored by cover value (70%) and distance from threat (30%)

### How It Works

#### Shooting Mechanics
1. When colonist fires, `coverPenalty()` calculates cover between shooter and target
2. Cover objects near target reduce accuracy: `accuracy = baseAccuracy × (1 - coverValue)`
3. Results:
   - 75% wall cover → 25% accuracy
   - 50% rock cover → 50% accuracy
   - 30% tree cover → 70% accuracy

#### Cover Seeking
1. `CombatManager` evaluates nearby cover objects
2. Calculates positions around each cover object
3. Scores positions based on cover value and tactical positioning
4. Colonist moves to best cover position

#### Enemy Usage
- Enemies automatically benefit from cover when positioned behind objects
- No special AI needed - cover is passive
- Defensive lines can be used against you if enemies advance

## Testing

### Manual Test Scenarios
See `docs/COVER_TEST_SCENARIOS.md` for detailed test cases:
- Wall cover scenario
- Stone chunk cover scenario
- Tree cover scenario
- Multiple cover types scenario
- Enemy using defensive lines scenario
- Cover seeking behavior scenario

### Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Vite build successful
✅ No errors or warnings

## Files Modified
- `src/game/combat/pawnCombat.ts` - Cover penalty calculation
- `src/game/combat/combatManager.ts` - Cover position evaluation

## Files Added
- `docs/COVER_MECHANICS.md` - System documentation
- `docs/COVER_TEST_SCENARIOS.md` - Test scenarios
