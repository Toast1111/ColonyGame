# Mountain Generation System Refinement - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The mountain generation system had several issues:
1. Buildings could be placed over mountain tiles
2. Mountain tiles didn't properly break when mined (resource system issues)
3. Ores didn't have their own floor item definitions
4. Missing ore type definitions (Coal, Copper)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Building Placement Validation (`src/game/placement/placementSystem.ts`)

**Issue**: The `canPlace()` function only checked for collisions with buildings, trees, and rocks - not mountain tiles.

**Fix**: Added mountain tile collision detection:
```typescript
// Check if building overlaps any mountain tiles
const startGX = Math.floor(rect.x / T);
const startGY = Math.floor(rect.y / T);
const endGX = Math.floor((rect.x + rect.w - 1) / T);
const endGY = Math.floor((rect.y + rect.h - 1) / T);

for (let gy = startGY; gy <= endGY; gy++) {
  for (let gx = startGX; gx <= endGX; gx++) {
    if (isMountainTile(game.terrainGrid, gx, gy)) {
      return false; // Cannot place building on mountain tiles
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: 
- Buildings cannot be placed on mountain tiles
- Ghost preview shows red when hovering over mountains
- Preserves existing collision checks for other obstacles

### 2. Ore Resource Definitions

**Issue**: Coal and Copper ore types were referenced in code but not defined in the item database.

**Fixes Made**:

#### a. Item Database (`src/data/itemDatabase.ts`)
Added Coal and Copper item definitions:
```typescript
{
  defName: 'Coal',
  label: 'coal',
  description: 'Black combustible rock, useful as fuel.',
  category: 'Resource',
  equipSlot: 'none',
  stackable: true,
  maxStack: 75,
  value: 2,
  weight: 0.8
},
{
  defName: 'Copper',
  label: 'copper',
  description: 'Reddish-brown metal used in wiring and construction.',
  category: 'Resource',
  equipSlot: 'none',
  stackable: true,
  maxStack: 75,
  value: 4,
  weight: 1.2
}
```

#### b. ItemType Union (`src/game/types/items.ts`)
Extended ItemType to include all ore types:
```typescript
export type ItemType = 'wood' | 'stone' | 'food' | 'wheat' | 'bread' | 
  'medicine' | 'metal' | 'cloth' | 'coal' | 'copper' | 'steel' | 'silver' | 'gold';
```

#### c. Floor Item Properties (`src/game/systems/floorItems.ts`)
Added visual and stacking properties for all ore types:
```typescript
coal: {
  weight: 0.8,
  stackLimit: 75,
  stackRadius: 22,
  color: '#1f2937' // Dark gray/black
},
copper: {
  weight: 1.2,
  stackLimit: 75,
  stackRadius: 22,
  color: '#b45309' // Reddish-brown
},
// ... (steel, silver, gold)
```

**Result**: All ore types now have complete definitions and can be dropped as floor items.

### 3. Mining Resource Dropping (`src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`)

**Issue**: Mining code used string comparison with `.toString()` and typed resource as `keyof Resources` instead of `ItemType`.

**Fix**: Improved ore-to-item mapping:
```typescript
// Determine resource type from ore - oreType enum values match ItemType
let resourceType: ItemType;
switch (oreType) {
  case OreType.COAL: resourceType = 'coal'; break;
  case OreType.COPPER: resourceType = 'copper'; break;
  case OreType.STEEL: resourceType = 'steel'; break;
  case OreType.SILVER: resourceType = 'silver'; break;
  case OreType.GOLD: resourceType = 'gold'; break;
  default: resourceType = 'stone'; break; // Plain stone or none
}

// Drop resources on the ground as floor items
const dropAt = { x: worldX, y: worldY };
(game as any).itemManager?.dropItems(resourceType, amount, dropAt);
```

**Result**: 
- Ores correctly drop as floor items instead of being added to abstract resource pools
- Proper type safety with ItemType enum
- Each ore type has distinct visual appearance based on color

## System Integration

### Existing Systems That Work Correctly

1. **Terrain System** (`src/game/terrain.ts`):
   - Mountain generation with procedural noise
   - Ore deposit placement (5 types with varying rarity)
   - Ore visibility (fog of war system - ores only visible when exposed)
   - `mineMountainTile()` converts mountain to grass terrain

2. **Mining Work System** (`src/game/workGivers/mining.ts`):
   - Correctly prioritizes exposed mountain tiles within mining zones
   - Uses `isMountainTile()` and `getVisibleOreAt()` for validation
   - Manages tile assignment to prevent multiple colonists mining same tile

3. **Rendering System** (`src/game/render/index.ts`):
   - Mountains render with gradient shading and angular ridges
   - Visible ores show as colored highlights matching ore properties
   - Ghost building preview uses `canPlace()` for red/green indication

4. **Navigation System**:
   - Mountains marked as impassable (cost: 999.0)
   - Navigation grid rebuilds when mountains are mined
   - Colonists can path through mined areas

## Technical Details

### Ore Distribution (Procedural)
- **Plain Stone**: ~35% (most common)
- **Coal**: ~25%
- **Copper**: ~15%
- **Steel Ore**: ~12%
- **Silver**: ~8%
- **Gold**: ~5% (rarest)

### Mining Yields (Base, modified by skill)
- **Stone**: 3 per tile
- **Coal**: 5 per tile
- **Copper**: 4 per tile
- **Steel Ore**: 6 per tile
- **Silver**: 3 per tile
- **Gold**: 2 per tile

### Mountain HP by Ore Type
- **Coal**: 70 HP (softest)
- **Stone**: 80 HP
- **Copper**: 90 HP
- **Silver**: 100 HP
- **Gold**: 110 HP
- **Steel Ore**: 120 HP (hardest)

## Code Quality

### Architecture Adherence
✅ **No code added to Game.ts** - All changes made in appropriate system files:
- `placement/placementSystem.ts` - Building placement logic
- `colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts` - Mining behavior
- `data/itemDatabase.ts` - Item definitions
- `types/items.ts` - Type definitions
- `systems/floorItems.ts` - Floor item properties

✅ **Minimal Changes** - Only touched necessary files, preserved existing functionality

✅ **Type Safety** - Proper use of TypeScript enums and union types

### Security
✅ **CodeQL Analysis**: Passed with 0 alerts

### Testing
✅ **Build**: Successful TypeScript compilation and Vite build
✅ **Testing Documentation**: Created comprehensive test plan in `MOUNTAIN_SYSTEM_TESTING.md`

## Files Modified

1. `src/game/placement/placementSystem.ts` - Added mountain collision check (9 lines)
2. `src/data/itemDatabase.ts` - Added Coal and Copper definitions (26 lines)
3. `src/game/types/items.ts` - Extended ItemType union (1 line)
4. `src/game/systems/floorItems.ts` - Added ore floor item properties (35 lines)
5. `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts` - Fixed mining resource drop (11 lines)

**Total**: 5 files changed, 82 lines added, 12 lines removed

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Building Placement**: Try placing buildings on mountains - should show red ghost
2. **Mining Mechanics**: Create mining zone, verify colonists mine exposed tiles
3. **Ore Floor Items**: Check that all 5 ore types drop with correct colors
4. **Navigation**: Verify pathfinding updates after mining
5. **Ore Visibility**: Confirm fog-of-war system (interior ores not visible until exposed)

### Debug Console Testing
```bash
mountains reveal    # Expose all ores for testing
spawn colonist 3    # Add colonists
resources unlimited # Test building placement
speed 3             # Speed up testing
```

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

These were NOT part of the problem statement but could be added later:
- Smelting/refining system for raw ores
- Crafting recipes using ore resources
- Mountain generation biomes (more/less ore-rich regions)
- Mining efficiency based on tool quality
- Ore stockpile zone filtering

## Conclusion

All issues mentioned in the problem statement have been addressed:
1. ✅ Buildings CANNOT be placed over mountain tiles
2. ✅ Mountain tiles properly break and yield ore resources as floor items
3. ✅ All ores have floor item definitions with proper visuals
4. ✅ Coal and Copper ore types fully defined

The implementation follows the codebase's architecture patterns, makes minimal changes, and maintains type safety throughout.
