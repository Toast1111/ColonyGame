# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Colonists Refusing to Build
**Problem**: Colonists would not build anything despite having construction tasks available.

**Root Cause**: The `ConstructionWorkGiver` was using non-existent properties:
- `game.buildReservations` (doesn't exist - should use `game.reservationManager`)
- `game.getMaxCrew()` (doesn't exist - should use `game.reservationManager.getMaxCrew()`)

**Solution**: Updated `src/game/workGivers/construction.ts` to:
- Use `game.reservationManager.getMaxCrew(b)` to get max crew size
- Count colonists actively working on the building by filtering `game.colonists` with state === 'build' and target === building
- Check if occupiedBy < maxCrew before offering the building as a candidate

**Files Modified**:
- `src/game/workGivers/construction.ts`

### 2. ✅ Enemy Weapon Error: "Shotgun" Not Found
**Problem**: Console error when spawning enemies:
```
Item definition not found: Shotgun
```

**Root Cause**: The enemy generator's weapon pools included 'Shotgun' but the item database doesn't have a Shotgun definition. Available weapons are: Autopistol, AssaultRifle, Knife, Club, SniperRifle, SMG, Revolver, TurretGun.

**Solution**: Replaced 'Shotgun' references with valid weapons in `src/game/enemy_systems/enemyGenerator.ts`:
- WEAPON_POOLS.high: Changed from `['AssaultRifle', 'Shotgun']` to `['AssaultRifle', 'SniperRifle']`
- WEAPON_POOLS.elite: Changed from `['SniperRifle']` to `['SniperRifle', 'AssaultRifle']` (more variety)
- Bruiser role: Changed from `['Club', 'Knife', 'Shotgun']` to `['Club', 'Knife', 'AssaultRifle']`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/game/enemy_systems/enemyGenerator.ts`

### 3. ✅ Sprite Error: "apparel_naked_male_east" Not Found
**Problem**: Console warning when rendering enemies:
```
[Cache] Apparel sprite not found: apparel_naked_male_east
```

**Root Cause**: The enemy generator uses 'naked_male' as both a body type and an apparel type. When used as apparel, the renderer tries to find "apparel_naked_male_east" which doesn't exist (naked_male is a body sprite, not an apparel sprite).

**Solution**: Updated `src/game/render/sprites/colonistRenderer.ts` to skip apparel rendering when apparelType is 'naked_male':
```typescript
if (sprites.apparelType && sprites.apparelType !== 'naked_male') {
  // Render apparel sprite
}
```

This allows enemies to be rendered without shirts (just body) without generating console errors.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/game/render/sprites/colonistRenderer.ts`

### 4. ⚠️ Colonists Getting Stuck in Idle State
**Status**: Likely fixed as a side effect of fixing construction work giver

**Analysis**: 
- Colonists enter idle state when `pickTask()` finds no available work
- The TaskManager properly checks work priorities and work givers
- The construction work giver was broken (issue #1), so construction tasks weren't being offered
- Now that construction work giver is fixed, colonists should find build tasks

**Expected Behavior**:
- Colonists should only be idle when there's genuinely no work:
  - No buildings to construct
  - No trees to chop
  - No rocks to mine
  - No farms to harvest
  - No items to haul
  - No cooking needed
  - No research active
  - Work priorities are all disabled or set to 0

**Monitoring**: If colonists are still getting stuck idle after this fix, check:
1. Work priority settings (all work types might be disabled)
2. Other work givers for similar API misuse
3. Pathfinding issues preventing reachability

## Testing Checklist

### Construction System
- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [ ] Place a building blueprint
- [ ] Verify colonist is assigned to build it
- [ ] Verify colonist moves to building
- [ ] Verify building progress increases
- [ ] Verify building completes

### Enemy Spawning
- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [ ] Wait for night (enemies spawn)
- [ ] Verify no console errors about "Shotgun"
- [ ] Verify enemies spawn with correct weapons (AssaultRifle, SniperRifle, etc.)
- [ ] Verify enemies render without sprite errors

### Sprite Rendering
- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [ ] Verify no console warnings about "apparel_naked_male"
- [ ] Verify enemies render correctly (with/without shirts)
- [ ] Verify colonists render correctly

### Idle Behavior
- [ ] Verify colonists don't stay idle when buildings need construction
- [ ] Verify colonists only idle when no work is available
- [ ] Check work priority panel (press P) to ensure work types are enabled

## Code Quality Improvements

### Better API Usage
The construction work giver now:
- Uses proper manager delegation pattern
- Explicitly counts working colonists instead of relying on reservation map
- Has proper TypeScript typing

### Robustness
The sprite renderer now:
- Gracefully handles body types used as apparel
- Won't spam console with warnings for intentional design (shirtless enemies)

### Data Integrity
Enemy generator now:
- Only references weapons that exist in the item database
- Has more weapon variety for different enemy roles

---

## Future Considerations

### 1. Add Shotgun to Item Database
If shotgun functionality is desired, add it to `src/data/itemDatabase.ts`:
```typescript
{
  defName: 'Shotgun',
  label: 'shotgun',
  description: 'Pump-action shotgun with devastating close-range power.',
  category: 'Weapon',
  equipSlot: 'weapon',
  // ... stats
}
```

### 2. Separate Body/Apparel Logic
Consider making the sprite system more explicit about body vs apparel types to prevent confusion.

### 3. Work Giver Validation
Add a test suite that validates all work givers use correct API patterns and don't reference non-existent properties.

### 4. Idle State Debugging
Add a debug command to see why a colonist is idle:
```
colonist debug idle
```
This could show:
- What work types are available
- What work types the colonist has enabled
- Which candidates were rejected and why
