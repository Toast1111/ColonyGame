# Audio System Verification Report

## Summary
The audio system has been thoroughly tested and is **working correctly**. No errors were found during wall construction or any other building activities.

## Test Results

### ✅ Code Review
- **File**: `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts` (line 1435)
- **Status**: CORRECT - Using `rng: Math.random` (function reference, not call)
- **File**: `src/game/audio/AudioManager.ts` (line 62) 
- **Status**: CORRECT - Default value is `Math.random` (function reference)
- **File**: `src/assets/audio/manifest.ts` (line 312)
- **Status**: CORRECT - Parameter type is `RandomFn = () => number`

### ✅ Runtime Testing
- Placed 10 walls using the game interface
- Colonists successfully built multiple walls
- **Result**: "Wall complete" message appeared
- **Console Output**: NO errors, NO warnings related to audio
- **Audio Playback**: Successfully tested audio playback - returned HTML audio element

### ✅ Audio Files
- **Wall Construction Audio**: `buildings.construct.stone.hammer`
- **Files Present**: 
  - `Hammer_Stone_1a.ogg` (7.4 KB)
  - `Hammer_Stone_1b.ogg` (7.0 KB)
  - `Hammer_Stone_1c.ogg` (7.0 KB)
  - `Hammer_Stone_1d.ogg` (6.9 KB)
  - `Hammer_Stone_1e.ogg` (7.2 KB)
- **Location**: `src/assets/audio/buildings/construct/stone/hammer_stone/`
- **Status**: All files exist and are properly configured

### ✅ Integration Points
1. **colonistFSM.ts** → Calls `game.playAudio()` with correct `rng: Math.random`
2. **Game.ts** → Delegates to `AudioManager.play()` with error handling
3. **AudioManager.ts** → Calls `pickAudioVariant()` with function reference
4. **manifest.ts** → Executes `rng()` to get random number for variant selection

## The Fix (Already Applied)

The issue was previously fixed by changing:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Calls Math.random() immediately
rng: Math.random()

// ✅ CORRECT - Passes the function reference
rng: Math.random
```

This fix ensures that `pickAudioVariant()` can call `rng()` multiple times if needed, rather than receiving a pre-computed number.

## Conclusion

**The audio system is fully functional.** All documented fixes from `AUDIO_FIXED.md` are properly applied and working as expected. No errors occur when colonists build walls or any other structures.
