# Medical System Revamp - Summary

## What Was Done

### ‚úÖ Completed Changes

1. **Added Medicine Resources**
   - Added `medicine` and `herbal` resource types to game
   - Initial stock: 5 medicine, 3 herbal
   - Files changed: `src/game/types.ts`, `src/game/Game.ts`

2. **Made Medical System Accessible**
   - Changed `getColonistId()` from private to public
   - Allows FSM to properly identify patients
   - File changed: `src/game/health/medicalSystem.ts`

3. **Created Implementation Guides**
   - `MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md` - Full design document with RimWorld-inspired system
   - `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide with code snippets

### üìã What Needs Implementation

The system is designed but needs these critical pieces to function:

#### 1. Medical Job Assignment in FSM ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**File:** `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`
**Line:** ~445 in `evaluateIntent()` function

Add before the "heal" check:
```typescript
// Medical work - ALL colonists can treat injuries
if (!c.inside && !danger && c.health && c.health.totalPain < 0.6) {
  const medicalJob = medicalSystem.findMedicalWork(c, game.colonists, game);
  if (medicalJob) {
    set('medical', 95, 'medical work available');
  }
}
```

**Without this, colonists will never perform medical work!**

#### 2. Medical Treatment Handler ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**File:** `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`  
**Line:** ~590 (after existing medical check)

See `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` Problem #3 for full code.

**Without this, medical state will crash!**

#### 3. Downed State Handler ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
**File:** `src/game/colonist_systems/colonistFSM.ts`
**Line:** ~800

See `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` Problem #5 for full code.

**Colonists can be set to "downed" but won't handle it properly**

#### 4. Auto-Downed State Trigger üîß **IMPORTANT**
**File:** `src/game/health/healthSystem.ts`
**Line:** ~103 in `updateHealthStats()`

**File:** `src/game/Game.ts`
**Line:** ~1100 in main update loop

See `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` Problem #6 for full code.

#### 5. Fix Context Menu Medical Actions üîß **IMPORTANT**
**File:** `src/game/Game.ts`
**Lines:** ~2387-2405

Replace all medical case statements with working implementations.
See `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md` Problem #4 for full code.

#### 6. Rescue System üì¶ **FUTURE**
**File:** Multiple files
- Add rescue FSM states
- Add carrying mechanics  
- Auto-create rescue jobs for downed colonists

See `MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md` Phase 2 for full design.

## Current State

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
- Medical system infrastructure exists
- Medicine resources are tracked
- Treatment definitions are complete
- Quality calculation based on skill + medicine
- Medical job creation and assignment logic

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work Yet
- Colonists don't automatically perform medical work (no FSM integration)
- Medical state crashes if triggered (no handler)
- Downed colonists can't be rescued (no rescue system)
- Context menu medical actions don't work (wrong treatment IDs)
- No automatic transition to downed state (no health check)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Make Medical Work Functional (30 minutes)
1. Add medical job check to FSM `evaluateIntent()` 
2. Add medical state handler to FSM
3. Fix context menu medical actions
4. Test: Colonists should treat each other

### Phase 2: Downed State (20 minutes)
1. Add downed state handler to FSM
2. Add automatic downed state trigger
3. Improve rescue context menu action
4. Test: Severely injured colonists should collapse

### Phase 3: Full Rescue System (1-2 hours)
1. Add rescue job creation
2. Add rescue/carrying FSM states
3. Carrying mechanics (patient follows rescuer)
4. Automatic rescue job assignment
5. Test: Downed colonists automatically rescued to beds

### Phase 4: Polish (30 minutes)
1. UI improvements (treatment quality indicator)
2. Better injury summaries
3. Medicine stock display
4. Active treatment notifications

## How to Use This

1. **Start with `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md`** - Contains exact code to copy/paste
2. **Implement fixes in order** - Each fix builds on the previous
3. **Test after each fix** - Make sure it works before moving on
4. **Reference `MEDICAL_SYSTEM_REVAMP.md`** - For design philosophy and future features

## Testing Checklist

After implementing each phase:

**Phase 1:**
- [ ] Hurt a colonist (let enemy attack)
- [ ] Another colonist moves to them automatically
- [ ] Treatment completes after duration
- [ ] Injury improves (check via debug panel)
- [ ] Context menu medical actions work

**Phase 2:**
- [ ] Severely injure colonist (multiple wounds)
- [ ] Colonist collapses when health too low
- [ ] Can't move while downed
- [ ] Context menu shows "Rescue" option
- [ ] Rescue teleports to bed and starts rest

**Phase 3:**
- [ ] Downed colonist automatically creates rescue job
- [ ] Healthy colonist picks up job automatically
- [ ] Carries patient to nearest bed
- [ ] Patient delivered and enters rest state
- [ ] Treatment continues while in bed

## Key Design Principles (RimWorld-Inspired)

1. **Everyone Can Treat** - All colonists can perform medical work
2. **Skill Matters** - Higher skill = better quality, faster treatment
3. **Medicine Improves Outcomes** - Significant quality boost
4. **Automated Job System** - Medical work auto-assigned by priority
5. **Emergent Gameplay** - Systems interact to create stories

## Example Scenario (When Fully Implemented)

1. **Combat**: Colonist "Alice" shot by raider, takes gunshot to torso
2. **Injury**: Severe bleeding, high pain, consciousness dropping
3. **Collapse**: Alice's consciousness drops below 30%, she collapses (downed)
4. **Alert**: Game message: "Alice has collapsed!"
5. **Rescue Job Created**: System finds nearest bed, creates rescue job
6. **Rescuer Assigned**: "Bob" (healthy, nearby) automatically takes job
7. **Carrying**: Bob runs to Alice, picks her up, carries to bed
8. **Delivery**: Bob places Alice in bed, she enters "resting" state
9. **Treatment Job**: "Carol" (skill 8 Medicine) automatically takes medical job  
10. **Treatment**: Carol moves to bed, treats Alice with medicine
11. **Quality**: Treatment quality 85% (skill 8 + medicine bonus)
12. **Result**: Bleeding stopped, infection prevented, pain reduced
13. **Recovery**: Alice rests in bed while wounds slowly heal
14. **Return to Work**: Once conscious and pain manageable, Alice returns to tasks

## Notes

- The system is designed to work with existing colonist generator and skills
- Treatment quality formula: `baseQuality + (skill * 0.03) + medicineBonus`
- Medicine bonus: None (0%), Herbal (+10%), Medicine (+20%), Advanced (+30%)
- All treatment durations are modified by skill: `baseDuration / (1 + skill * 0.05)`
- See full treatment definitions in `src/game/health/medicalSystem.ts` lines 28-112

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** `medicalSystem.getColonistId is not a function`
**Solution:** Already fixed - method is now public

**Issue:** Colonists ignore injured allies
**Solution:** Need to implement Phase 1 - medical job check in FSM

**Issue:** Game crashes when colonist enters medical state
**Solution:** Need to implement Phase 1 - medical state handler

**Issue:** No medicine displayed in UI
**Solution:** Add medicine display to resource UI (future enhancement)

## Quick Start

1. Open `MEDICAL_QUICK_FIX.md`
2. Copy code from Problem #1
3. Paste into `colonistFSM.ts` at specified line
4. Copy code from Problem #3  
5. Paste into `colonistFSM.ts` at specified line
6. Test the game - colonists should now treat each other!
7. Continue with remaining fixes

**The foundation is built. Now it just needs the FSM integration to come alive!**
